CAPE TOWN - In what has been described as a ground-breaking victory, student protest actions led by the UCT Student Representative Council (SRC) not only led to the lifting of the fee block for local students but also for those across the continent.“We welcome this toilsome victory and also welcome council’s commitment to reviewing and mobilising its resources towards the alleviation and clearing of historical debt. The SRC will also take part in a joint working group with management to ensure the accountability and efficiency of these processes,” said SRC acting president Siyabulela Plaatjie.Hopes for a full return of in-person classes at the start of this academic year were short-lived owing to student protest actions against registration delays and the exclusion of those with outstanding fee debts.On Monday, UCT’s council held a special meeting to consider the student grievances when it was agreed that the institution would suspend the block on students re-registering for the 2021 academic year.This suspension was for one year only and, for the 2022 academic year, students with fee arrears of more than R10 000 have so far not been permitted to register, subject to appeal.MORE ON THISUCT council meets over  mounting student debt‘Missing middle students vulnerable to debt challenge’UCT to convene special Council meeting to reconsider fee block policyCouncil chairperson Babalwa Ngonyama said: “We also know that there are students with fee debt higher than R10 000 who have the potential to complete their courses of study. The special meeting of the council was called to consider the plight of these students.’The current fee block on student registrations should be removed for the 2022 academic year for all students who are eligible to re-register on academic grounds. This concession will apply to students who are South African citizens, South African permanent residents, from SADC countries and from other countries in Africa.”Plaatjie said having won the battle over fee blocks, and continuing to ensure all are registered, some of their remaining demands would be looked at through different university structures.Education activist Hendrick Makaneta hailed the decision, suggesting that other universities should follow suit and allow students with debt to register.“We applaud the UCT council for taking a conscious decision to allow students to register. The decision will certainly go a long way to ensuring that students are able to create a future for themselves. These students have demonstrated that they can study in a difficult environment of Covid-19 for the past two years. Those who have passed really deserve the chance to finish their degrees,” Makaneta said.Cape Times
