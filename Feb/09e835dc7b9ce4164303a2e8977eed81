DURBAN - The KwaZulu-Natal Beach Clean Up volunteer movement agreed with the statement made by the Institute of Waste Management of Southern Africa (IWMSA) that waste-pickers deserved more recognition for their environmental contribution.The IWMSA has acknowledged the role played by waste-pickers. The CSIR stated that in 2014 alone informal pickers saved municipalities between R309 million and R748m in landfill airspace. This by simply diverting recyclables from landfills.The beach clean-up movement was started in 2011 by a group of friends wanting to keep their local beach clean, but has now become a movement getting communities to take action against marine pollution through clean-ups, awareness and activism.Spokesperson Presha Soogrim said their overall goal was to facilitate in changing the mindsets of the public, specifically the youth.“Instead of leaving a better Earth for our children, we need to leave better children for our Earth. We are committed to working locally to improve the quality of our oceans and waterways, making them safer for the creatures that inhabit them as well as for the community, thereby contributing towards a sustainable future.”MORE ON THISWaste pickers ‘deserve more recognition for their environmental role’ says the Institute of Waste Management of Southern AfricaWeighing up the value of waste pickersEx-Mushroomville waste pickers face hunger, have no means to earn moneySoogrim said that KZN Beach Clean Up was of the view that the amount of recyclable waste that goes to landfills in communities was because we lack the much-needed recycling infrastructure, which was “shameful".“Not only do waste-pickers divert recyclables from landfill clearing space, but they are also building a recycling economy which is much needed in the waste and climate crisis we find ourselves in.”Soogrim said waste-pickers provided an essential service to our communities and environment and should be afforded the respect they deserved.“Unfortunately, the conditions they work in are often not safe or hygienic. We hope they can be assimilated into the formal economy where they can work in safer conditions and earn a living wage.”Daily News
