CAPE TOWN - The mother of a Grade 4 pupil at Willows Primary School in Heideveld says her daughter has been left traumatised after she was allegedly assaulted by a teacher with a pipe.Distraught mother Sinekhaya Mbawuli said her daughter had missed a number of days at school as a result of alleged assaults, including an incident with a pipe.Mbawuli said the school called her on Thursday morning and suggested that the pupil be taken to another class.“This is hurting me because this is not the first time my child has been complaining about this. At first, I thought she was just being naughty, but… this is serious. Last week she was beaten by the same teacher because she was making noise and apparently she was not the only one making noise but the teacher chose to beat her and left others.“She did not attend school for days last week. When she decided to go to school on Wednesday, that is when she was beaten by the teacher at her back with a pipe. She told me that she is not going to school again. I tried to call the teacher just to get clarity but she was arrogant and did not want to co-operate with me, she instead insulted my daughter for being the tallest in the class,” said Mbawuli.Western Cape Education Department (WCED) spokesperson Millicent Merton said if there is substantive reliable evidence for a charge of misconduct, the teacher will be formally charged.“Corporal punishment is regarded as serious misconduct. The WCED has a policy of zero tolerance with regards to corporal punishment,” said Merton.SA Democratic Teachers’ Union (Sadtu) provincial chairperson Jonovan Rustin said corporal punishment does not serve any purpose within the education sector.Read more in Friday’s Cape Times.Cape Times
