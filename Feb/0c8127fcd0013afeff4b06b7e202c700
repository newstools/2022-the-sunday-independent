IT'S deeply disheartening for the Zimbabwean government leadership to continue displaying its careless ways in regards to the lives of the young generation.There is nothing significant or constructive that they are providing about youth unemployment, channels towards promoting entrepreneurship programmes, democratic, functional and well-planned communities. The young generation desperately requires programmes that enable them to positively participate to better their lives, family/social circumstances and democratic freedoms.Hence, they are aimlessly roaming the streets, looking for means of survival, but all that surrounds them is a sense of abandonment and isolation. Roaming the hopeless streets or environments makes them feel like they've been under a cloud of rejection – no sense of entitlement, no sense of belonging in their own country.Therefore, they have resorted to indulging in harmful, toxic drugs, alcohol abuse (addiction), giving them a false sense of working or taste of brother/sisterhood and something to do to fill the gap in their long hopeless day. Unfortunately, they have no control over the negative implications to their health in a country with poor medical infrastructures, oppressive medical costs, lack of psychiatric support and staff, hence, causing lifelong impact experiences leading to one becoming quite a resentful individual, and can also be an avenue to the development of health problems, such as stroke, heart disease, mental health, high blood pressure, and sleep disorders.The Zanu-PF-led government should stop behaving in a clueless, corrupt, careless manner, and urgently implement government-funded projects throughout the country and stabilise the economy, ensuring that employment opportunities, entrepreneurship programmes and democratic, functional and well-planned communities are available.Failing to implement positive changes has serious repercussions, as they unite and overwhelmingly vote against President Emmerson Mnangagwa in the forthcoming presidential elections. They will carry on with crossing the dangerous crocodile-infested Limpopo river into overburdened neighbouring countries such as South Africa.BEVERLEY TSITSI MUTANDIRO | LondonDaily News
