CAPE TOWN - More accused are expected to be added in the case against alleged underworld figure and accused killer Nafiz Modack, along with his co-accused Zane Killian, Jacques Cronje, Ricardo Morgan, Amaal Jantjies and Jannick Adonis and Anti-Gang Unit cop Ashley Tabisher.This emerged during court proceedings on Monday where the seven appeared in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court.National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the matter was postponed to April 19 for further investigation and “more accused are going to be added”.Previously the court heard, during a bail application for Modack, Cronje and Tabisher, that the State “has a prima facie case against the accused” and that investigations were at a “sensitive stage".The seven accused are before court for the alleged murder of top cop Charl Kinnear and face a slew of other criminal charges amounting to more than 3 000 counts. These include the “illegal pinging” made on the cellphones of a number of people including alleged underworld figures Jerome “Donkie” Booysen and Ralph Stanfield, axed SAPS detective boss Jeremy Vearey, top lawyer William Booth and his wife Nicolette, mayoral committee member for Safety and Security JP Smith and slain top cop Charl Kinnear.Police watchdog the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) confirmed they would be investigating allegations made by Tabisher against senior police personnel.Ipid spokesperson Grace Langa had said: “Ipid confirms the matter is under investigation. We investigate the allegations and not an individual. The preliminary outcome will lead us to the person to be called to account for whatever we would have found. At this stage we do not investigate an individual or target any person but we investigate allegations brought to our attention.”
