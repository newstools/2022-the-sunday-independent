CAPE TOWN - The JSE has cautioned the public against a scam using its name on WhatsApp to con unsuspecting victims out of their hard-earned cash.“The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) is aware of a WhatsApp-based scam using the name ’JSE INVESTMENT’,” JSE senior client service manager Tshililo Manenzhe said."In this scam, potential investors are urged to deposit money into one of several bank accounts provided and promised guaranteed returns. This is a scam and it is not authorised by the JSE. There is no JSE-affiliated legal entity called ’JSE INVESTMENTS’. We urge the public not to participate in this scam.”He said they were taking steps to put a stop to it.“We are taking all the necessary steps to stop the spread of this unlawful operation, including alerting the relevant authorities such as the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA).“The JSE does not employ agents to recruit investors. The JSE offers investors a trading platform facilitating the buying and selling of a variety of financial instruments. The JSE does not invest funds on behalf of the public, nor do we offer investment advice to the public. The only way to invest on the JSE is via an authorised JSE stockbroker.“A list of stockbrokers can be found on www.jse.co.za.Similar investment scams can be reported to info@jse.co.za.Meanwhile, the 2021 KnowBe4 African Cyberthreat Report found that people were still taking risks in spite of their growing awareness and understanding of cybercrime.The report focused on key metrics around cybersecurity awareness and behaviours to gain a holistic view of the continent’s cyber stance and how users perceived the threats, collating insights from 763 respondents across South Africa, Botswana, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Mauritius and Nigeria.“The report found that while people are paying more attention to security, they are still falling prey to scams and attacks that they could have avoided. From social engineering to investment scams, the threats are gaining ground. Considering that around 34% have lost money because they fell victim to a scam, and 26% have experienced a social engineering attack over the phone, it is clear that cybercriminals remain determined to use any means necessary to catch people unaware,” KnowBe4 said.The report can be found at: https://www.knowbe4.com/hubfs/2021-African-Cybersecurity-Research-Report-Whitepaper.pdf.Cape Times
