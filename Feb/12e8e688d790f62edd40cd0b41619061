Cape Town - So far 3 600 hectares of vegetation has burned in the ongoing Gysmanshoek, Hessequa fire.Garden Route District Municipality (GRDM) on Tuesday said the wildfire has now burned for eight days in the region. It is reported to be 90% contained.To date one home has been lost, while seven have been saved by firefighters.“Unfavourable north- easterly winds (Monday) night caused the wildfire to spread further west and the fire-line therefore extended. This area is inaccessible to ground crew.“Ground crew members are currently busy implementing further preventative fire breaks to ensure no spread occurs to the closest infrastructure down south and south west toward the Duivenhoks River.MORE ON THISHessequa blaze rages on, fuelled by windCeres fire under control, Hessequa blaze still rages“No infrastructure is currently under threat,” the GRDM said.The wind conditions did not affect the south eastern area toward the plantations and Oudebosch and no flare-ups were detected, they added.On Monday, the GRDM had said that the wildfire was still active within a deep gorge on the west toward the Boosmansbos Reserve.On the south-easterly flank and north-west of plantations it was decided to not yet use a mulching machine.
