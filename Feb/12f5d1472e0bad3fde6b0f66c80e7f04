Picture: Metro police/suppliedThere were many reactions online after news of the ‘zip gun’ spread. On social media, some of the comments included: –  "The lock is to make it sound like he is cocking the gun"–  “A lock for your glock”–  "If you lost the key for that lock then the gun is no used.“– “This weapon might be the joke for many but this is where the stray bullets comes from that's killing our children.”– "This guy is a genius. South African Engineering.“–  “That’s actually a real gun, the lock features as a ‘finger’ so the shooters finger print don’t get on the trigger, the tape play a similar role, so prints wont be on the gun, reason for one bullet are simple.. The magazine's button are taped shut (also so no prints will be on the magazine) at the back of the locks sliding pin should be a pin that imitates a finger. That’s actually a hitman’s gun and not a amateur hitman but one who knows he wont miss, usually used at close range/point blank. That’s how most killers gets free because there are no concrete evidence against them only hear say stories and we all know that don’t stick in a court.”If i get robbed with a fake gun, i won't forgive myself....
