LOAD shedding is the deliberate shutdown of a part or parts of a power distribution system generally to prevent the failure of the entire system when demand puts strain on the capacity of the system.During load shedding parts of the network are switched off according to a predetermined schedule, with the impact spread equitably over Eskom’s customer base.Load shedding is predictable and allows for customers to plan accordingly. There should be no load shedding at the moment: South Africa will have a lot of tourists from all over the world as a tourist destination. Many tourists will stay in hotels. They need food, to have a bath and to iron their clothes. These people will become sceptical about our country where there is no electricity and it will give our country a bad reputation.Load shedding also causes a lot of inconvenience to our people as well. Eskom can overcome the load shedding by looking at other ways of generating electricity. For example, they can get electricity by building wind turbines and using solar panels to generate electricity. Eskom should not rely on coal only.BRUCE CHINNIA | PhoenixDaily News
