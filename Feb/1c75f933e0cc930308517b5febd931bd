DURBAN - Recent criticism directed at advocate Dali Mpofu SC, who is also a member of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), is perceived to be an attack on black professionals in South Africa.The JSC conducted interviews for the position of Chief Justice last week.Mpofu has been a subject of criticism for his conduct during the interviews with some groups calling for his removal from the JSC panel, arguing that Mpofu is unfit to hold office.Media24 editor-in-chief Adriaan Basson published an article referring to Mpofu as a “nincompoop” and “scoundrel with thuggish behaviour”.Freedom Under Law, a non-profit organisation that promotes democracy under law and advances the principle of legality, said Mpofu should not be participating in the proceedings due to investigations into his conduct. He told a colleague and her client Pravin Gordhan to shut up during the state capture inquiry when Mpofu was disrupted while he was talking.MORE ON THISLegal eagles swoop on Basson for ‘colonial racist’ remarksDeputy Chief Justice Zondo appeared to be withholding information about his meetings with politicians, says professorPoliticians deserve a right to be in the JSC; analyst says outrage is manufactured and irrationalThe calls for Mpofu to be removed from the JSC have been met with resistance from some sections of society who expressed concern over what they described as “racially motivated and undermining of black professionals”.Former chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts and leader of the African People’s Convention, Themba Godi, said there is a desire to “manage the natives” by the liberal grouping seeking to drive the narrative that black professionals are generally incompetent.“Look at the narrative around president Nelson Mandela, his popular image is a liberal construct. Whenever public issues are debated, the ‘experts’ are predominantly white. The 1994 political settlement was a triumph of liberalism. Thus anyone who veers off the liberal script is brutally brought to book.“To give it ‘universality’ they employ native reactionaries as their echo chambers. Though a numerical majority, Africans are a cultural and economic minority. Public morality always depends on what they want, not law or principles.”Godi said the uproar about the JSC interviews showed how some people could not accept an outcome that goes against their wishes.“The demonisation of certain people is because they are seen as being contrary to the dominant view of the white minority. The minority in this country has stuck to its perspectives and interests, which are contrary to the imperatives of transformation,” said Godi.President of the ANC Women’s League, Bathabile Dlamini, said there are NGO’s working with the media, the courts and other sections in society to “stir fights” among people to ensure that the focus on critical issues is distracted.“When speaking about renewal in the organisation, it seems it is only about the ANC and not the economic emancipation of our people.“They sit and plan together and give the agenda to NGOs and agree on who should be attacked. They make a lot of noise about someone they want to destroy until state leaders agree to isolate you.”Dlamini said that her party, in its analysis of “how the enemy works”, talked about the current unfolding signs of “infiltration and control” of the society through NGOs.She added: “The types of factions that we see in the form of foundations and break-away parties that are funded by owners of the economy divide us. These NGOs upped their game and yes, some journalists and black professionals work for these people.”Leader of the Real Democracy, Srini Naidoo, said not all black professionals were targeted.“Dali Mpofu, and others who go against their agenda are vilified because they do not bow to those wealthy arrogant and racist individuals.”Asked whose interests Freedom Under Law represents, chairperson of the organisation, Judge Johan Kriegler, denied that his organisation was targeting black professionals.“We don’t have a ‘constituency’ and we act in the public interest.”Approached for comment, Mpofu said: “I hope that this episode will mark the beginning of black solidarity against unwarranted racist attacks from the usual suspects”.Daily News
