DURBAN - THE damage caused by the purging of municipal officials in some municipalities where political leadership changed hands after the local government elections has led to calls for the rules governing appointments to be tightened to prevent a similar occurrence in future.Thando Tubane, the head of the KwaZulu-Natal Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) department, said the recent purges had led to the loss of institutional memory and destabilised municipalities.In an opinion piece written in his personal capacity, Tubane said even the call by Cogta MEC Sipho Hlomuka for the purges to stop was ignored.Tubane said Cogta should consider tightening legislation and setting up a body to safeguard the rights of the workers to ensure that the issue does not arise again.Following the local government elections last year, many municipalities in the province changed hands.MORE ON THISHigh Court reserves judgement but the IFP is still in charge of the Mtubatuba Local MunicipalityIFP and ANC pursue their court contest for the control of Mtubatuba Local MunicipalityKZN Cogta MEC Sipho Hlomuka recommends the IFP and NFP take their clash over the executive committee in the Nongoma Municipality to courtKZN Cogta MEC warns new councils against purging officials on suspicious groundsThe IFP-led Zululand District Municipality faced accusations of staff purging after it fired several workers on the grounds that they were not qualified to hold the positions they were in.There were allegations that it had also targeted officials that had campaigned for its fiercest rival in the northern areas, the National Freedom Party.The municipality denied any allegations of staff purges.Tubane said: “It is now clear that the call (by the MEC to stop purges) was not heeded and things have in fact deteriorated with ever more senior municipal officials being recalled due to a perception that they were somehow associated with a previous political leadership of their respective municipality.“Since November 1, 2021, when we elected new municipal governments across KZN, some municipal officials, including several municipal managers, have fallen victim to new administrations uninterested in their hard-earned experience and apparently intolerant of the country’s overarching commitment to build a capable developmental state.“As a result, we have not only seen the institutional memory of these municipalities challenged to the detriment of effective service delivery but we have also, on a purely human level, observed instances of individuals with families losing their jobs and livelihoods,” he said.“In order to reverse this dangerous trend of changing the composition of municipal officials after changing the political leadership of municipalities, we now clearly need to consider legislative options that will prevent such practices from reoccurring – or at least make them much more difficult to achieve in the future.“What we may consider is an apolitical statutory body that would protect the interests of municipal officials – and civil servants in general – by balancing them against the need of their respective state institutions to deliver on their long-term developmental objectives,” he said.Political parties said municipalities had a right to hold officials accountable and to deal with those accused of wrongdoing. But they added that there should be no unwarranted attacks on officials.DA KZN leader Francois Rodgers said the party valued the skills of municipal officials and any further regulations should be aimed at reining in the decline in service delivery and ensuring that officials did their jobs and were suitably qualified for those positions.“In the case of uMngeni Municipality (where the DA governs) we have said we are not interested in which party the officials belong to, but their ability to do their jobs,” he said.The IFP’s spokesperson on Cogta, Otto Kunene, said no municipal official should be fired without cause.“But we should differentiate – there are instances where officials had been implicated in wrongdoing under the previous administration which did not act and the new administration has to act on such allegations of wrongdoing,” he said.THE MERCURY
