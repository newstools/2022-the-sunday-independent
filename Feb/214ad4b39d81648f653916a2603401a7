IQBAL KHANTOURISM in KwaZulu-Natal will receive a major boost this week with the influx of over 1 200 travelling golfers, their caddies, television crew, European and Sunshine Tour officials and overseas guests who arrived in the city for this week’s inaugural $250 000 Jonsson Workwear Open at the iconic Durban Country Club and Mount Edgecombe Country Club.The tourism industry has suffered immensely due to the prolonged Covid pandemic and this international event which features top professionals from 27 countries across the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia, Far East, Australia and New Zealand will at least help kick-start the economy in the province in some small way.As an added boost Nick Jonsson, chairman and chief executive of JONSSON Workwear, announced at the launch of the event that the company’s sponsorship would initially be for three years with an option to renew in the final year of the agreement.“We, as a company, are in this whole-heartedly because of our love for the province and the city,” said Jonsson. “We believe KwaZulu-Natal needs an iconic professional golf tournament to showcase the city of Durban and the province of KwaZulu-Natal.”MORE ON THISTop international golf heads to Durban Country Club after over a decadeSuperSport, the host broadcaster, will televise the championship live from Durban Country Club on the weekend of November 26-27 into sub-Saharan Africa and 51 other countries across Europe, the United Kingdom, Far East, Australia and New Zealand.
