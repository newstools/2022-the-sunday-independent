The City responds to the article ‘Outrage as City of Cape Town discontinues the Walking Bus project, replaces it with ’discriminatory’ initiative’, published in the Cape Argus on Thursday, 27 January 2022.The Walking Bus project was not “disbanded” and it is incorrect to say it was replaced with a unit to only guard municipal workers.The new safety project aims to professionalise the former walking bus programme, giving qualified applicants better security training and equipment, and a broader scope of duties in the community. This is an important step in our plans to make Cape Town safer. The City encourages volunteers from the former Walking Bus volunteer project in the City of Cape Town to apply, as the initiative moves to the Safety and Security Directorate.MORE ON THISOutrage as City of Cape Town discontinues the Walking Bus project, replaces it with ’discriminatory’ initiativeScholar transport drivers on edge as effects of taxi war drags onMayor Dan Plato honours 1 500 Walking School Bus volunteersPlato calls for R18.6m for walking bus, other ‘pet projects’Among the functions, these teams will specifically help in protecting service delivery crews in identified crime hotspots across the city. These teams include water, fire, electricity, sanitation and cleansing crews who face danger and violence while trying to do their jobs to improve service delivery in communities. These future changes promise to provide even greater safety to our most vulnerable areas.* Luthando Tyhalibongo, Spokesperson: City of Cape Town.** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.Cape ArgusDo you have something on your mind; or want to comment on the big stories of the day?
