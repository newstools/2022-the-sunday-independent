Cape Town - This weekend proved to be a particularly eventful one for the City’s firefighters after fires broke out in two historic buildings in the city – a church and a school.A fire was started in St George’s Cathedral, where late Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s remains were buried, in the early hours of Sunday, allegedly by an arsonist who fled the scene.City Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson Jermaine Carelse said an emergency call was received at 1.52am reporting smoke billowing from the basement of the cathedral.He said the person required to open the cathedral had to travel from Pinelands to unlock the doors.“Eventually permission was given to break one of the steel bars to gain access to the basement where the rubbish was burning,” Carelse said.MORE ON THISDesmond Tutu’s ashes interred in St George’s Cathedral, call to rename Cape Town airport after himFirefighters douse a fire after suspected arson attack at St. George's CathedralHe said the fire was extinguished at 3.54am, and that there had been no damage to the structure of the building.The dean of the cathedral, Reverend Michael Weeder, said their preliminary investigation showed that a burning cotton ball had been thrown into the basement through a barred window near the steps leading up to the cathedral’s main entrance.Tutu’s remains were interned at the cathedral on January 2, just blocks away from Parliament, which was also set ablaze on the day he was buried.Police spokesperson Wesley Twigg said an arson case had been opened for investigation.
