Cape Town - A Gugulethu family are struggling to make sense of the death of their 86-year-old grandmother, whose body was found entangled in a shirt with one eye gouged out.Charlotte Madolo’s body was found in her bedroom at the weekend by her 12 and 13-year-old granddaughters, who couldn’t bear the trauma after the grim discovery of their grandmother’s body.Madolo’s distraught daughter, Lindelwa Bovana, said she was called by the two children while attending a funeral of a relative not far from her home.Bovana said the two children told her to quickly come home, because they noticed that their grandmother was not well.“My mother was epileptic, so I thought she had suffered from it and fell from her bed, while we were away at the funeral,” Bovana said.MORE ON THISANCYL leader in W Cape steps aside amid party squabbles over handling of GBV chargesThree women’s bodies found less than 24 hours apart in Langa, Gugulethu and TulbaghGugulethu residents demolish shack of a man suspected of raping a minor and put him in hospitalCharlotte Madolo, 85 years old, was killed in Gugulethu on Saturday.

My heart was torn apart,” Bovana said.“I know she fought for her life, that is why she was entangled with a shirt, and her eye gouged out.”She said her mother was a “soft-spoken” woman, maybe that is why no one heard her cry during the incident.Bovana described her mother as a disciplined woman, a mother who cared and wanted the best for her children, and her community.Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said the police were investigating a murder case after Madolo’s body was found by her daughter who immediately informed the police at about 3.39pm in NY 132 Gugulethu on Saturday.Van Wyk said sterling investigation by Gugulethu detectives led to the arrest of a 48 year-old man in connection with the murder. He was due to appear in court once charged.When the Cape Argus visited Madolo’s home on Sunday, community members, neighbours, ward councillor, Bongani Ngcombolo, community policing forum (CPF) representative and a social worker visited the family expressing their condolences.Lindelwa Bovana daughter of Charlotte Madolo, 85 years old, who was killed in Gugulethu.
