DURBAN – The EFF-led Student Representative Council at the Durban University of Technology (DUT) held a protest on Monday over their grievances regarding the institution’s registration processes, and lack of student accommodation.According to the chairperson of the EFF’s student command, Nkululeko Mzobe, the institution’s online registration processes are not efficient.“The online registration process has failed dismally, like last year. We are expecting classes to commence next Monday, but we haven’t even reached 50% registration,” said Mzobe.Students chanting liberation songs at DUT.

So classes will not be in sync because there will be some who are more prepared than others,” said Mzobe.MORE ON THISDurban University of Technology extends online registration periodDUT announces campus closures ahead of students march on FridayWATCH: Protesters harass DUT staff and destroy equipment after they were told walk-ins were not allowedHe stated that their submission to the institution was that returning students and first-time applicants should this week be assisted with in-person registrations, and be accommodated into residences, and only after that process should classes begin.Mzobe added that they are also experiencing difficulties with getting student accommodation due to the issues with registration. “There is also a crisis of accommodation at the student residences. We have students who have received firm offers at DUT but they haven’t finished all the steps of registrations. By virtue of receiving a firm offer, you stand to be a student at DUT but as we speak, there is no proper set-up for those students to be accommodated in terms of housing and accommodation,” he said.DUT on Monday afternoon released a statement refuting claims that it is accepting walk-ins or conducting physical registrations, after it said a fake communique was circulated.In the statement, it noted that due to an extension of the online registration lectures were scheduled to commence on February 21 with the continuation of the offering of multi-modal, online teaching and learning to returning students.The institution added that permits to access campus will only be granted to first year students, and students who are enrolled for exit modules to attend mask-to-mask lectures on campus. Other permits will be issued to students who require access to practical laboratories and students whose conditions at home are not conducive to learning. It added that access to premises will only be granted to students who meet the criteria of the policy choices on vaccination of staff and students. THE MERCURY
