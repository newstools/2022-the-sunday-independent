DURBAN - The National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) has warned the public against keeping wild animals as pets after the recapture of an escaped pet anaconda.The two-metre long anaconda escaped from its temporary enclosure at its owner’s residence in Starwood, Phoenix, north of Durban, last week but was recaptured by Monday.The NSPCA said the escaped snake would have had to fend for itself in a habitat that it was unfamiliar with, which placed it at risk of injury, disease and death - all of which could have been avoided had it not been “condemned to be part of the cruel pet trade since its birth”.“The public is reminded that just because the animal is a snake, does not make it any less sentient than a cat or a dog or less deserving of respect,” the NSPCA said.“The NSPCA is vehemently opposed to the keeping and/or breeding of any indigenous and exotic wild species in captivity for purposes other than bona fide conservation or rehabilitation purposes in facilities approved by the council.”MORE ON THISIt is illegal to purchase any indigenous wildlife without a permit, warns the NSPCAMissing Phoenix anaconda Medusa has been foundStill no sign of missing 'pet' anaconda that slithered out of Phoenix home enclosureA pet anaconda is on the loose in Phoenix and people are freaking out on FacebookIt urged the public to refrain from keeping wild animals as pets and visiting facilities that keep wild animals in captivity for entertainment purposes.“The NSPCA has actioned the Durban and Coast SPCA to conduct a follow-up inspection on the condition of the anaconda,” the NSPCA said.The organisation which last month called on people not to purchase wildlife without a permit, said these animals belonged in the wild in their respective countries.This is how Facebook users reacted:Angela Brinkley: “And then the poor animal would have to go back to its little glass prison to live like that for the rest of its miserable life. But there are animal 'lovers' that keep snakes.”Sihle Nkosi: “Sad because some people keep them in very tiny glasses. I see now that most black people are adopting to this culture, this other guy kept his snake in a small dark box. It’s sad. Even keeping that pretty bird in a cage is wrong!”Gerda Kruger: “I totally agree, they belong in nature. It should be illegal to have any exotic animals. I can’t even stand the fact that people keep birds in cages… extremely cruel.”Daily News
