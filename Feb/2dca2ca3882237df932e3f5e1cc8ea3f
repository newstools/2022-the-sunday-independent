DURBAN - While socio-economic factors are one of the primary driving forces forcing people to relocate closer to the Durban CBD, the eThekwini Municipality is struggling to keep the city clean.The city has raised concerns over illegal dumping and littering in the streets, stating that it remained a serious issue because it negatively affected the environment.This comes after the Daily News posed questions about what initiatives the city would take to address illegal dumping and littering and the increase of homeless people in the city.EThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said litter clogged up our stormwater drains and washed into our rivers and oceans, which was a danger to all marine life. Illegal dumping could also cause accidents on the road, and posed serious environmental health issues.“We believe in having thriving communities, and a clean environment is so important in ensuring that we have healthy communities. We ask that our residents refrain from illegal dumping and littering.”MORE ON THISDurban suburbs struggling with rat and fly infestationWar of words between metro police and Department of Social Development over vagrants’ removal under M4 bridge freeway near Albert ParkMore plastic bottle caps than cigarette butts on KZN beaches with International Beach Clean-UpInternational Coastal Clean-up Day teams clean up Durban coastSantaco teams up with eThekwini Municipality in drive to slam the brakes on litteringAs part of the intervention programmes aimed at preventing littering, Mayisela said that there were hundreds of bins in various parts of the city, and urged residents to make use of them.He added: “Leaving face masks carelessly on our streets to be picked up by city employees puts their lives in danger and spreads Covid-19.”Last month during a media session with the deputy mayor, Philani Mavundla, concerns were raised about the increase of homeless people.Mavundla said that some were intimidating city cleaners and preventing them from doing their jobs.In August last year, SA National Taxi Association spokesperson Sfiso Shangase urged the public to stop littering and urinating in taxi ranks and other public spaces.Shangase said they had partnered with the eThekwini Municipality to help clean the city.Daily News
