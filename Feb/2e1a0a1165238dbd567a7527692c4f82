CAPE TOWN - The Office of the Public Protector has confirmed it is investigating the handling of the DNA backlog within the SAPS’ Forensic Science Laboratories.The public protector’s spokesperson, Oupa Segalwe said the investigation “is still in its early stages”. The investigation follows a complaint lodged by civil rights organisation Action Society, against Police Minister Bheki Cele; the DNA Oversight Board; SAPS; the State Information Technology Agency SOC Ltd (Sita); and President Cyril Ramaphosa in October last year.Action Society asked the public protector to investigate these parties for their alleged failure to deal with the backlog of DNA evidence in a sufficiently expeditious manner.Action Society said the investigation would mean saving the lives of survivors of violent crime in South Africa.“The absence of justice, with court cases being dragged out and postponed increases and prolongs trauma for survivors that have been subjected to these violent crimes and families of victims who are seeking closure.“The public protector investigation will reaffirm that senior leadership in the Presidency and in the Ministry of Police, due to their negligence and apathy, has blood on their hands,” Action Society spokesperson Elanie van der Walt said.The organisation’s attorneys have also sent a letter to the SAPS, addressing various concerns regarding progress in the turnaround strategy to deal with the DNA backlog. “Although an urgent turnaround strategy to eradicate the backlog was presented to the Portfolio Committee on Police in August 2021, it doesn’t seem that real progress has been made. Public-private partnerships … were supposed to launch on October 1, 2021, but almost three months later, they are still not operational,” Van Der Walt said.Another issue that Action Society said required urgent attention, was the alleged shortage of personal protective clothing at two laboratories.Cape Times
