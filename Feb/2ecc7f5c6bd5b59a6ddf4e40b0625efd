Cape Town - Kensington Home for the Aged has appealed to the public to lighten its load so as to provide optimum and enhanced services to its residents.Interim manager Mona Angers said the home had minimal funds for much-needed projects affecting the services to its elderly residents. The Home for the Aged has a capacity and renders care and services to 100 frail aged residents, with the majority of residents having dementia.“We have one vehicle to transport residents to and from hospital visits. The vehicle needs to be replaced and therefore it’s not reliable any longer.Repairs are costing the home. “Our water heating system needs replacement. Cost for a heat pump is quoted at R40 000. We are also in need of recliner chairs for the frail residents,” said Angers.MORE ON THISKensington Home for the Aged appeals for assistance for new vehicleKensington Home for the Aged now Covid-19 free after battle to contain spreadAngers said flooring and interior painting would be appreciated and all would make a meaningful difference in the lives of its residents.The home’s Arts and Crafts facilitator Helen Louis said: “My purpose at the Home is to keep our residents’ hands busy on a daily basis. “The activities are dominoes, cards, Rummikub, Uno, ball games, swing ball to help with hand/eye co-ordination, and memory games for the dementia patients. “I also do walk therapy for those who are in wheelchairs, knitting, crochet, sewing, beading, etc. It’s a real joy working with the elderly, it gives them hope for each and every new day. “It would be greatly appreciated to receive any form of donation towards our Arts and Crafts centre. Music is one of our biggest forms of entertainment, it helps to calm them at times and also enhances their dancing skills, taking them back down memory lane.”Donations or volunteers are welcomed with those interested encouraged to contact Kensington Home for the Aged on 021 593 2285shakirah.thebus@inl.co.zaCape Argus
