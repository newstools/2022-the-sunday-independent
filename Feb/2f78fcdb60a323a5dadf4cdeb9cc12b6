CAPE TOWN: The AA says the government must find ways to mitigate against rising fuel costs and has renewed the call for a review of the fuel-pricing model before next week’s Budget Speech.“Our economy is closely linked to the fuel price; it is a major input cost in the manufacturing, retailing and agricultural sectors,” the AA said.“We have noted before that a review of the current structure of the fuel price, as well as an audit of all the elements which comprise the fuel price, should be done sooner rather than later.“We therefore call on the Minister of Finance (Enoch Godongwana) to initiate such a review during his Budget Speech on February 23,” the AA said on Tuesday.The Association also urged Godongwana not to increase the fuel levies that were part of the fuel price.“We know all too well of the economic challenges facing the country, and of the importance of the revenue raised through the two main levies. We are also aware that, as was the case last year, delivering a Budget in the current economic environment is tricky and difficult and that the pressure to ease government’s financial burden is immense. “However, increasing the levels of the General Fuel and Road Accident levies will be counter-productive as this will impact mostly on the poorest of the poor,” the AA said.The General Fuel Levy was R3.93 a litre, up from R3.77 in 2021, and the RAF levy R2.18 per litres, up from R2.07 in 2021. Combined, they added R6.11 to every litre of petrol and diesel sold in the country, the AA said.“Our country faces enormous and complex economic challenges. High fuel prices are adding to these challenges and instead of accepting the current model, we must seek solutions that benefit consumers, not place them in more financial distress. “One immediate solution for us, for instance, is to review the funding of the poorly managed Road Accident Fund (RAF). Our reliance on the RAF is a direct result of South Africa’s poor road safety and that’s where more attention needs to be given for a long-term solution,” the AA said.The Association said signatures from the AA’s petition calling on Godongwana to #ReviewTheFuel in his Budget Speech next Wednesday would be submitted along with a letter expressing the AA views on the levies.View the petition: https://aa.co.za/review-the-fuel/.
