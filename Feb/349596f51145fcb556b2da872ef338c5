Testicular cancer and prostate cancer concept.Mpho Rantaompho.rantao@inl.co.zaThe conversation surrounding contraception is always a contentious topic⎯ especially when the focus shifts to men. It is not to say that a lack of education is solely to blame (even though it accounts largely).It is rather the idea behind any man going under the knife to sterilise themselves that seems to terrify them out of their boots and question their identity or their masculinity.A common narrative is that women carry the most burden of using contraception to prevent pregnancies and protect themselves from infections, using a variety of methods including sterilisation through a hysterectomy. However, men though limited, are offered contraceptive solutions in the form of condoms and a vasectomy.For those unfamiliar, a vasectomy is done by cutting and sealing tubes called vas deferens that carry sperm; keeping it out of semen. Once cut, a man will still produce sperm, but it is soaked up by your body and cannot reach the semen, meaning you won’t be able to get a woman pregnant.Vasectomies are offered in two forms: a conventional vasectomy wherein the procedure permanently sterilises a man; and a no-scalpel vasectomy.The difference? One is a permanent sterilisation method, while the other is an outpatient procedure that allows for the reconnection of the vas deferens if a man later decides to have children.The discussion surrounding men’s sexual health and their choices in contraception was highlighted in the story of 29-year-old attorney Jag Fakude. Fakude went viral on Twitter after sharing that he had undergone a vasectomy at a reproductive services clinic in Centurion.Fakude explained that he had shared his procedure on Twitter for the sake of being social and transparent, but was surprised to see it go viral over the particularly negative reactions by men who interacted with his post.“That bit [reactions] was unexpected because I didn’t think so many men would react so negatively to the procedure. But it also showed me that education regarding men’s bodies is very lacking, as some responses conflated vasectomy with castration,” Fakude explained.The outcry and slight condemnation by men over Fakude’s procedure highlighted a very disappointing fact about many men in our country: they don’t know anything about their own bodies and may feel ashamed by this. The question is why?The concept of sterilisation should be promoted rather than condemned over the known fact that it has a 90-99% rate of not conceiving. It is often regarded as one of the best forms of birth control.Director of the Male Fertility Program at Penn Medicine in the United States, Dr Puneet Masson, MD adds, “It’s very common for men and couples who never want children or don’t want any more kids to choose a vasectomy.”And it’s not as though the procedure is as permanent as many of us have been led to believe. Vasectomies can be reversed depending on the way in which the original procedure was conducted. Dr. Masson said that the reversal of a vasectomy could only be effective depending on the length of time since the procedure.“If the reversal is within 10 years of the vasectomy, the success rate is about 60 to 75%. But after 15 years, it can drop to 30%,” he explained.Those triggered by another man’s decision to seal his tubes carrying his sperm shows that our education department haven’t not done due diligence in explaining fundamental information about the human body and all of its complexities when it comes to reproduction.“I distinctly remember that throughout the entirety of my high school, essentially all that we were taught about was abstinence. That is a failed approach to sex ed because we have said time and time again, that you cannot teach only abstinence because we’re human beings and sex is going to happen,” Fakude said.“When you teach abstinence you fail to teach healthy alternatives to keeping safe in terms of sex in general and managing reproduction. That is why a lot of these young men end up looking for alternative ways because condoms aren’t that effective and pulling out is essentially useless.”When the Department of Basic Education had suggested the idea of introducing more sexual education in schools, it was met with major backlash, including from late AmaZulu leader King Goodwill Zwelithini, who slammed the suggestion in a 2020 speech saying: "God is not in this and our culture does not allow it."Subjects like Life Orientation are not taken seriously by school pupils for its lack of depth in the lessons that are meant to last with us for the rest of our lives.Had proper investment been made and bias removed from the so-called taboo subjects, the country would be taking greater strides in decreasing the alarming rates of teenage pregnancies; and to an extent the violence against women and the LGBTQIA+.“The crazy part is that I’ve been having this conversation a lot with women in the media and on social media,” the attorney said. “It’s not me speaking to a man who has never considered this and is now asking about how this functions and how to play a more active role in contraception.”The advancements made in the medical community with regards to the creation and access of contraceptive methods for both men and women highlights the diminishing burden on women. It also leaves men with less reasons to oppose opting for sterilisation or other contraceptives.It forces them (and women) to face an unfriendly fact: any form of contraception promoted by the autonomy of one’s body removes the autonomy men have over others. It exposes the patriarchy in sexual education and most importantly, it exposes men’s own fear of losing autonomy over their own bodies.Until the country’s educational resources improve and become more inclusive, and until men are more open to the conversation of contraception for themselves ⎯  the taboo label hanging over vasectomies shall forever remain.Sunday Independent
