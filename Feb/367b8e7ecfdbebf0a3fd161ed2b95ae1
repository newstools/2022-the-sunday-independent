He stopped the bakkie and asked the two boys to push it. His accomplice followed under the pretence he would be helping them. He then heard numerous gunshots from his accomplice who had killed the two boys and got back into the vehicle as they drove back to Manenberg.He said although his accomplice held the firearm and shot and killed both victims, he intended to carry out the hit and instructed him to murder the two minors. Sauls was previously convicted of murder in June 2009 and still on parole when he committed this double murder.State prosecutor Nathan Adriaanse welcomed the sentence. “Unlicensed firearms are a serious problem in the Western Cape, especially when used by gangs to further their activities. The firearm used in this crime has not been traced and is still out there in public.”rafieka.williams@inl.co.zaCape Argus
