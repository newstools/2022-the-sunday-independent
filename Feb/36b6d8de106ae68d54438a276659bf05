As of now, there are 15 schools which are planned to be upgraded or replaced in 2021/22. “This is in addition to 129 mobile classrooms delivered thus far, with 173 more in the process of being delivered,” Botha said.ANC provincial spokesperson for education, Khalid Sayed, said the meeting confirmed their view that Education MEC Debbie Schäfer does not have a clear plan to build new schools in poor working-class communities affected by the crisis of unplaced learners and overcrowded classrooms.Sayed said despite it being clear that the root cause for those challenges was the shortage of schools and insufficient placement spaces, the WCED and DTPW explained that the issue of building brick-and-mortar schools was always a last resort.“It is concerning that the WCED treats this matter as a short-term problem, when in fact it has been a thorny issue for so many years,” he said.Responding to Sayed, Schäfer said: “It seems we were in a different meeting.”African Christian Democratic Party provincial leader Ferlon Christians said the overcrowding of schools and the inability by the WCED to place learners timeously was of great concern.Christians said the roll-out of the mobile classrooms was an interim measure to accommodate learners.“I have asked the WCED to give the committee the assurance that unplaced learners have access to learning material. They indicated that there is that initiative in the district,” he said.sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.zaCape Argus
