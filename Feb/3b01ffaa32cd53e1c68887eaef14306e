CAPE TOWN - The investigation into the die-off of more than 1 600 Cape fur seal pups and sub-adults on South Africa’s West Coast last year has shown that the deaths were the result of a variety of factors including malnutrition.In a joint statement on Thursday, the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, the Western Cape State Veterinary Services and the Cape Of Good Hope SPCA said post-mortem examinations conducted on pups and sub-adults following the die-off found evidence of moderate to severe malnutrition, which led to the poor body condition of the mammals.The 2021 Cape fur seal die-off is the first of its kind since a similar occurrence in 1994/95.“Clinical signs, including convulsions seen in the video footage received suggest possible biotoxin poisoning. As a result, extensive testing for significant parasites and viruses, including distemper, as well as bacterial infections were conducted on all carcasses. The results have proven either negative, or insignificant. All result for biotoxins were also negative,” they said.Because of the neurological signs witnessed, similar tests will be conducted on adult carcasses as part of a more thorough investigation by the State Vet.The Berg River, Cape Town, Elands Bay, Lambert’s Bay and Saldanha Bay Municipalities reported that the number of carcasses their waste teams disposed of totalled 1 633 seals between September and November 2021.The die-off coincided with the period when seals prepare for their breeding season and colonies see an influx of mature individuals. Adverse weather, such as strong winds and storms, in September and October had previously resulted in large numbers of pups washing up dead or emaciated on beaches adjacent to breeding colonies.“National, provincial and local government, working with agencies and partners, will continue to monitor the situation. The department has issued a research permit allowing for further sampling and testing.”Cape Times
