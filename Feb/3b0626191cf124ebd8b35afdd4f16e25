CAPE TOWN - This Valentine’s Day, Cape Town toddler Gracelyn “Gracey” Green hopes to win over the hearts of thousands of strangers throughout the country in a desperate plea to save her life.The 14-month-old was diagnosed with juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) – a rare cancer of the blood that affects young children and her only chance of survival is a stem cell transplant.The South African Bone Marrow Registry (SABMR), which is facilitating a donor match for Gracey, is imploring those of colour to get tested to see if they could be a possible stem cell match. According to the SABMR, people of colour are under-represented in the registry and it is therefore much more difficult for patients with a diverse ethnic heritage to find a matching donor.A special donor drive will be held for Gracey later this month and her family have appealed for the public to show their support.Gracey’s mother, Shanique Green, died last June in a fire that destroyed the family’s home in Atlantis.Green had handed Gracey to a bystander through the window and went back to try to save her grandmother, but this proved fatal.Lorenzo Erasmus, Gracey’s father, says it took a long time to come to terms with Shanique’s death and then to hear the devastating news of Gracey’s illness was just too much to bear.“Doctors aren’t certain how long she will live without a transplant, but our focus right now is to find the best match. The better the match, the better her survival chance after the procedure.”Her aunt, Lizel Solomons, said symptoms first appeared in July last year when she noticed Gracey’s unusually swollen tummy. After a GP examined her, an ambulance was dispatched, and they were rushed to the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital.“A series of tests showed that Gracey had an enlarged spleen, liver and lymph nodes, which eventually led to a JMML diagnosis. It happens when certain white blood cells, called monocytes and myelocytes, don’t mature as they should. This can either happen suddenly or can be associated with other genetic disorders in some children. In Gracey’s case, it’s linked to the former.“Since the diagnosis, she’s been on several chemotherapy drugs to slow the spread of cancer cells and has undergone chemo without any improvement, so now our only hope is a stem cell transplant.“My plea is to everyone in our community to help find a donor for our little angel. There’s a match waiting for Gracey, but time is running out,” Solomons said.Zaahier Isaacs, acting head of patient services for the SABMR, says Gracey is classified as an “emergency transplant case”, which means there’s no time to waste.“In most cases, family members, especially siblings, are generally most suitable, but even then, only 30% of patients are lucky enough to find a suitable match among their relatives. That’s why we must cast the net wider to the public to find the best possible match.“Due to the family’s financial circumstances, all testing and collection of stem cells will be funded via the SABMR’s patient assistance programme. Everything is in place, now we just need a donor match.“It’s so easy to register as a donor and only takes a cheek swab to test if you’re a possible match – all free of charge,” said Isaacs.Those living in Cape Town and surrounds are encouraged to sign up at a special Donor Drive for Gracey on Saturday, February 26 at the Atlantis City Mall, Wesfleur Circle, Atlantis from 10am to 4pm.To become a donor, contact the SABMR on 021 447 8638 or email them at donors@sabmr.co.za.
