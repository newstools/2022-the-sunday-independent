The application was dismissed by Olivier.The NPA said the court had relied on the state’s evidence after Mani exercised her right to remain silent by not testifying in her own trial.It said senior Advocate Luthando Makoyi and the Hawks’ Colonel Zane Johnson had done a good job to secure the conviction.Mani is expected to be sentenced in March and will return to court on March 8 for pre-sentence appearance. She remains out on bail.IOL
