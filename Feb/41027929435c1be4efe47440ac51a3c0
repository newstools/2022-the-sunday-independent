Judge Piet Koen is expected to hand down his ruling in the matter of the leave to appeal application brought by Zuma on Wednesday. Zuma has applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal on the matter of state advocate Billy Downer. Zuma wants Downer to be removed from the prosecuting team in his arms deal corruption case. “The point really is that H.E. President Zuma will not be attending but will respect the court by sending his attorney to attend and formally receive the judgment. The foundation and family are always free to attend even on February 16 (Wednesday) if they are available,” Manyi continued. He emphasised that Zuma’s absence in court was not a sign of disrespect.THE MERCURY
