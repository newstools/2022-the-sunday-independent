Cape Town - While out in the Philippi community enabling residents to get their Covid-19 vaccine, the Western Cape government's Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Vaxi Taxi initiative was visited by an international delegation of health experts including World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.EMS spokesperson Deanna February said their officials kick started the weekend by serving the Philippi community.“The EMS Vaxi Taxi team continues to repurpose public spaces and partner with communities within the province to bridge the Covid-19 vaccination gap.“To date, EMS’ Vaxi Taxi team have enabled 8 131 individuals within the province to receive their vaccines, hassle-free. On Friday, February 11, 122 individuals were able to receive their vaccines at Philippi Plaza,” she said.The Vaxi Taxi team was visited by a delegation including Tedros, chief scientist at WHO Soumya Swaminathan, Belgian Minister of Development Cooperation Meryame Kitir and Director General of the national Department of Health, Dr Sandile Buthelezi.“The delegation praised the Western Cape, in particular the EMS officials, for running successful mobile vaccination outreaches and making it easier for people to access life-saving vaccines where they live,”  February said.Twenty-year-old community activist Yamkela Sibango decided to get his second dose and volunteered to assist the Vaxi Taxi team by encouraging his fellow residents to receive their vaccines.Sibango said he has decided to study Safety and Society so that he can help his community.“I enjoyed working with the EMS team and I will continue to encourage my friends and family to receive their vaccinations so that more lives can be saved,” said Sibango.Resident, Samkelo Gidigidi, 27, said he decided to take the vaccine so that he can protect his family.“I would like to encourage everyone to make the right choice and take the Covid-19 vaccine. I’ve seen too many individuals get very ill and pass away and I’d therefore like to urge everyone to get vaccinated,” Gidigidi said.EMS director Dr Shaheem de Vries said they would continue to go the extra mile to ensure that, through the EMS Vaxi Taxi partnership, they reach as many communities as possible.“The support which we have been receiving from our community partners is encouraging and we remain grateful to each one of our partners,” said De Vries.
