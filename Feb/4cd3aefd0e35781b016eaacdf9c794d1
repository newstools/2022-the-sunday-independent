CAPE TOWN - The triumph and perseverance of the 2021 National Senior Certificate (NSC) candidates were celebrated at Western Cape Premier Alan Winde’s Leeuwenhof residence in Cape Town on Thursday.The province’s top achievers were honoured with certificates and cash prizes.   For Rondebosch Boys High School pupil, Stefanos Panagiotidis who got 100% for both Mathematics and Physical Science, hard work and consistency is what paid off the most.“For the Grade 11s of this year, I would advise them to work hard and even harder when in matric.“These two subjects are a brick wall you have to start a foundation and build up.“For me it started in Grade 8 where even the homework I took seriously,” he said.Panagiotidis will study Business Science at UCT.Renke Lorio from DF Malan High School was named the top student in the province for English Home Language, and said she was quite surprised.“I am very happy that the hard work has paid off. Challenges I saw were changes in my routine.“It definitely wasn’t easy to adjust to the different way of living and in matric, one has a very full programme that requires balance of time managemen,” she said.Education MEC Debbie Schäfer said at first she had been “extremely” worried about the matric results.“I also know that our schools, districts and head office did phenomenal work in holding afternoon and weekend classes, providing revision materials, and online tutoring. These efforts really paid off,” she said.Cape Times
