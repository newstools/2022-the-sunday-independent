CAPE TOWN - In positive news for Cape Town commuters who use the Southern Line, Prasa has been granted a commercial licence by the Railway Safety Regulator (RSR) to run the “People’s Train” (new blue electric trains).In Gauteng, the regulator has granted Prasa a commercial licence to operate a commercial service with the new trains on the Saulsville line.The decision by the RSR comes as Prasa ramps up efforts to bring more rail corridors back to into operation across the country.The Metrorail Western Cape has been running the off-peak operations of the new electric trains on the Southern Line since November last year, while running the yellow grey trains during peak time. What the regulator's decision means is that the new trains can now run on both peak and off-peak hours.The “People’s Train” is part of Prasa’s modernisation programme that will bring a state-of-the-art rail service to the South Africans.“It is part of our brand promise to deliver modern, faster, reliable, and cost-efficient train services. Prasa is committed to the safety of employees, passengers, communities. Prasa also endeavours to protect its assets. “The commercial licences are key milestones in Prasa’s work to recover the corridors that were left decimated across the country due to theft, vandalism and the Covid-19 pandemic.“The road to recovery is a painful one, but all the work put in is starting to bear fruit. Some of the successes are very encouraging,” said David Mphelo, acting Prasa Group CEO.“Prasa has taken a phased-in corridor approach in the recovery of the services and will communicate details of the recovery plan for the 2022/23 financial year in due course.”
