Kholofelo Sekepe Maponya the brains behind 2UFoods. Picture supplied.This is a perennial problem in the outlets owned by black traders in the townships who would rather see their business go under than pool their resources together with others in the same trade.2UFoods is not operational yet but is intended to launch by April. With R60 million already pumped into the business, focus is now on marketing the business and working to get it ready to hit the ground running by launch.The business is the brainchild of Kholofelo Sekepe Maponya and Inkosi Sipho Mahlangu of the AmaNdebele. The two are from old money – the scions of families that ran successful black business outlets.Maponya is the son of Matome Maponya, the brother of late business mogul Richard Maponya. These Maponyas are not new to black business as they ran a successful Toyota dealership in the old days. Like his brother, Richard, Matome was an influential figure in the National Federated Chamber of Commerce (NAFCOC) alongside Dr Sam Motsuenyane. He was in the black business delegation that went to meet with the then exiled ANC leadership in Lusaka, Zambia, before the talks leading up to 1994.Inkosi Mahlangu comes from a similar background of black business.The company profile says: “2UFoods (Pty) Ltd is retail group borne out of the need for a solution to solve the long history of disparities in how the most marginalized of our population have been served and mostly underserved by major retailers in South Africa. The rural and township population have always been the pillar on which the South African retail market has been anchored.”“2UFoods was established in various forms in 2014/15 in order to service this hugely disregarded and underserved part of the South African population. Our unique model is premised on taking essential products through a delivery mechanism at no extra costs to the customer. This service is standard and even expected in more affluent parts of the country and the lack of this type of service in rural areas speaks to the level of indignity low-income shoppers has been subjected to for years.”The black buying power is traditionally huge but the customer is the most neglected and abused. Black people have been known to patronise businesses that do nothing for them in return. A Shoprite survey Maponya refers to indicates that 80% of shoppers buy from the group and 90% of its shoppers are township and rural folk.When they get the chance to run their own businesses, it is everyone for himself – a myopic business acumen, if ever there was one.The spaza shop in the township, which is as traditional as sorghum beer, is now virtually the sole reserve of outsiders.Maponya and Mahlangu are aiming to change this sad state of affairs in the local business landscape.Maponya explains the business model simply, showing that a lot of hard work went into building 2uFoods. It is a Spar-type business, only that blacks will run the business from end to end. The only ‘outsiders’ will be the coffee suppliers – Juan Valdez of Colombia, who Maponya says are the world’s biggest “not Starbucks.”Otherwise, everything else, including the logistics arm, will be black-owned.A franchise will sell for R1 million.While the aim is to launch 2UFoods with 300 outlets, the business already has 800 stores inland and 600 in KwaZulu-Natal.They have secured the support of such institutional clients as SANTACO, the taxi association, Maponya says.The 2U Foods business concept is made up of four businesses: the 2U Foods Movable Panel Store, the 2UFOODS Direct Distribution Centre, the 2U Foods Buying Group and MMI Property, where: - The MMI Property business owns the Movable Panel Store and all the equipment inside. This is on a no obligation turnover related basis which removes the upfront capital barriers.- The 2UFoods Movable Panel Store owner operates the store selling retail consumer goods, including Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) meals, to low-income customers.- The 2UFOODS Direct Distribution Centre supplies Movable Panel Stores with the retail products, bringing the benefits of cheaper prices through wholesale supply.- The 2UFoods Buying Group manages the independent operators and markets the 2U Foods brand to customers in the communities of Movable Panel Store operations.The business model says: The 2U Foods Movable Panel Store operator’s main responsibility is to operate the Outlet in such a way that it is profitable. This requires his/her ability not only to manage the stock and finances of the store (which the 2U Foods Buying Group will provide training for) but, more importantly, it requires the other businesses to perform their responsibilities in a manner that is cost- effective and efficient.If this fails, the black township entrepreneur must just pack up and hand over the spaza shop to foreign interests.Sunday Independent
