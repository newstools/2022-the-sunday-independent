DURBAN - The Durban University of Technology (DUT) has denied having a vaccination policy that denied people access to the university after the circulation of photographs on social media showing students sleeping outside the Steve Biko campus in Durban.The university said based on the photographs, social media users alleged the institution had a vaccination policy that denied these individuals access to its premises.DUT spokesperson, Alan Khan, said it was “malicious and misleading” to suggest that the university has a mandatory vaccination policy that was preventing its students or staff from gaining entry into the university.“The photographs circulating on social media platforms which were accompanied by malicious, misleading information about DUT having a mandatory vaccination policy preventing the internal university community and its stakeholders from entry onto university property or any current students from being allocated accommodation at the university’s student residences. The DUT council approved vaccination policy offers three options to students, staff and visitors,” Khan said.“For each member of the DUT community to access any of the DUT campuses, they must be fully vaccinated against Covid-19. If a member of the DUT community does not wish to vaccinate, they must then continue with online activities and services. If they are required to be on campus, they must undertake a Covid-19 PCR test 48 hours prior to being on campus and that test result must be negative.MORE ON THISTwelve cars set alight at two Durban University of Technology campuses in five days, guardhouse also torched - DUTNearly week-long university protests spread across SADUT condemns the spreading of fake news as SRC demands in-person registrationDUT opens case after Pietermaritzburg students torch and damage two cars, security guardhouse and cafeteriaDUT students protest over enrolment issues; give university an ultimatum“If a member of the DUT community refuses to be fully vaccinated and to provide a negative Covid-19 PCR test result when they may be required to be on campus, then they must continue with online based activities and services; in which case, should there be practical sessions, laboratory sessions and other academic and non-academic work that requires physical attendance, the principles referred to in the policy shall apply, including facing the consequences of the individual choices,” Khan said.He said the university had provided a free vaccination site in line with the requirements to access the institution.Student Representative Council chairperson, Nkululeko Mzobe, said the university did have a strict policy on vaccination, and that students should be allowed to make a decision to not vaccinate based on their human rights enshrined in the constitution.“Obviously, the management will deny having such a policy when it is faced with such backlash. But, there is a strong-arm policy denying students access to residence because of the vaccination.”“We are calling on the management to allow for students to exercise their right to vaccinate and to not vaccinate. I mean, students are willing to do the tests as the institution suggests, but should pull away from mandatory vaccination.”We are going to meet with the leadership of the university to find an amicable solution so that these students are not left behind in the academic year,” Mzobe said.Daily News
