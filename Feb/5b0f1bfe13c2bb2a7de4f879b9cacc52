However, we believe that the pair are only the implementers and we call for more investigations so that those who sent these two men are also arrested.”Hlengwa added that Ndima was a kind and humble servant of the IFP.“We hope the court process will lead to a comprehensive investigation and the arrest of all the suspects, but also so that we as a party and the family of councillor Reginald Ndima get closure.”In a separate matter, ward councillor Themba Mnguni and his co-accused Nomthandazo Mbeje were each granted bail of R5 000 on Friday after they appeared in court on three counts of murder; five counts of attempted murder; and a charge of conspiracy to commit public violence.The two have been charged in connection with a shooting in Inanda in September 2021 outside an ANC branch meeting in which three women who were ANC members were killed.Kara said: “Their bail conditions are that they must not interfere with witnesses and they must report bi-weekly to a police station, hand in their passports and relocate out of the area.”Nhlakanipho Ntombela, ANC KZN spokesperson, welcomed the arrest of the two suspects. “The court granted them bail … That is part of the court process and doesn’t have anything to do with the ANC. We welcome the arrest of the two suspects and we trust that the court process will ensure justice is served. We also hope that the family of the victims will find out the truth of what happened,” he said.Earlier this month, Police Minister Bheki Cele said detectives tasked with investigating political killings in KZN were making good progress and had secured convictions.THE MERCURY
