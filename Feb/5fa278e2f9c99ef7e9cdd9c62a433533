THREE cheers, that’s what comes to mind in terms of new Idols SA judges being appointed.We live in a changing world but it has taken the organisers (M-Net) too long to realise the show’s rating has plummeted to an all-time low.The best news was Randall Abrahams being shown the door. This was long overdue; he was the most unpopular judge. It was sad to see how he humiliated contestants and showed very little respect towards those who did not sing well.An excellent choice of new judges.We need people to bring back the fire in Idols. The organisers, by thinking ahead and being strategic, will be able to address the serious problem of the show losing viewers by rotating the judges every two years.Some of the judges have overstayed their welcome resulting in the show’s popularity dropping. It is time to build Idols to its former glory.DHAYALAN MOODLEY | Mobeni HeightsDaily News
