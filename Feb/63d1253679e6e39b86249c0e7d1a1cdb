Cape Town - Local favourite shore-side festival Moonstruck is back, however, this year the popular event will return as a hybrid music experience. Talk radio station CapeTalk and sponsor Simply Asia have announced that the popular event will also feature an all-female ensemble of stellar performers including three Idols winners.A limited number of music fans will be able to attend this unique event in person, while the rest of the country will enjoy it online - for free.Tessa van Staden, CapeTalk Station Manager said: "The event has such a rich heritage. Traditionally it's a time when families come together to enjoy each other’s company to the tune of great music. “That hasn't changed - fans can look forward to enjoying the music in their lounge, on the lawn or for a limited amount of fans - in person."This year the event celebrates home grown female musicians. The Lady Day Big Band is South Africa’s first all-female big band, consisting entirely of professional female musicians.
