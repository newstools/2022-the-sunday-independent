We continue to hold the families and loved ones in our hearts, fully cognisant that we will never be able to comprehend the extent of their loss and the profound vacuum their loved ones’ passing has left,” Friedland added.“This horrific tragedy occurred during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, when health-care workers across our country stood on the front lines. Their remarkable bravery and sacrifices are not forgotten. In Netcare alone, 75 front-line heroes lost their lives answering the highest call in the service of humanity. To recognise and pay tribute to all health-care workers, across all sectors in South Africa, both in the private and public sectors, and with the permission of the families, they, too, have been included in the memorial.”Daily News
