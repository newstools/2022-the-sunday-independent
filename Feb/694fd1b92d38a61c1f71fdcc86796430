Cape Town - The South African Constitution says the most basic forms of health care should be made accessible to all who reside in South Africa. However, this is not the lived experience of so many.With the launch of its new campaign ahead of Valentines Day, Sonke Gender Justice’s (SGJ) #UnderTheBlankets campaign aims to shed light on refugees’ and migrants’ right to access sexual and reproductive health services in South Africa.The non-profit organisation works throughout South Africa, and believes that everyone can work together to resist patriarchy, advocate for gender justice, and achieve gender transformation.South Africans and non-South Africans are encouraged to visit their web page and read about how to access government sexual and reproductive health services in the country, and to remind health-care workers that everyone in South Africa, regardless of their nationality, has a right to access these services.SGJ policy, development and advocacy specialist Namuma Mulindi said: “We are hoping to raise awareness, address taboos and misconceptions regarding sexual health, generally, and make people aware of where to access free services. “We are targeting migrants due to the lack of filter of information to migrant communities, as well as to combat medical xenophobia experienced by migrants.”Medical xenophobia refers to the attitudes and practices, by medical practitioners and health-care workers, towards a certain group, more specifically refugees and migrants, resulting in the medical mistreatment or maltreatment of the patient seeking health care.“There is a huge lack of awareness on issues related to sexual reproductive health. As statistics released by Gauteng Health Department have shown, more than 23 000 teenage pregnancies have been recorded. “More needs to be done to ensure people are aware of their rights as far as sexual reproductive health is concerned, and where and how to access sexual reproductive health services, as well as ensure those providing the services can be held accountable to do what is expected of them, based on knowledge of their rights,” Mulindi said.In a statement released, SGJ said all pregnant and lactating women, and all children under six years old, are entitled to free hospital care, including the termination (abortions), of pregnancies.“Outside of this, if a person is from a country in Southern Africa (SADC), they are entitled to be treated the same as a South African citizen at hospitals,” read the statement.The web page offers a data-free map showing both government (free) clinics and private clinics near the user’s location, and lists organisations and non-governmental organisations that can assist to access sexual and reproductive health care in South Africa, regardless of the individual’s nationality. shakirah.thebus@inl.co.zaCape Argus
