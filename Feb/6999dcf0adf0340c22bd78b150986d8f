CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has advised of water supply disruptions in both Fish Hoek and Khayelitsha next week.The City’s water and sanitation department will be completing construction work on the main water supply link to the Fish Hoek area, resulting in the disruption of water supply on February 16, from 9am until 4pm.The City said the construction work will impact the Fish Hoek area bounded by Kommetjie Road, 19th Avenue, Peter Creese Way and Simon’s Town Main Road.The water supply network across the City is divided into reticulation zones which are smaller and much more manageable sections of the large network, for purposes of maintenance and upgrades. This work forms part of the City’s Water Demand Management Plan and will assist in the measuring of input volume and monitoring of the zone.“The City regrets the inconvenience caused, and appreciates residents’ co-operation during this time,”  Mayco member for water and sanitation Zahid Badroodien said.The City’s water and sanitation department is also planning to shut down the water supply to Khayelitsha on February 17 at 10am until 3pm.This five-hour shutdown will allow for the replacement of the 800mm meter insert, near Mew Way and Old Faure Road and will result in the disruption of water supply to Khayelitsha.“As part of pro-active maintenance on the bulk water infrastructure to ensure continued water supply to the residents, and an effort to reduce unaccounted for water, the 800mm water meter insert near Mew Way and Old Faure Road will be replaced as it has been flagged as faulty," the City said.Residents are advised to store water in clean, sealed containers for domestic use.Cape Times
