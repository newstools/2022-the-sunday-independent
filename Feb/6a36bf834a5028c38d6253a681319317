Sometimes bystanders die because of being shot and, in some cases, pedestrians are hit by vehicles,” he said.Lamb said that he has seen a number of cases where police have been negligent in their driving but, sometimes in high-speed chases, where police are attempting to apprehend suspects, bystanders get injured or killed as a result of that.Anyone with information can contact Crime Stop anonymously at 08600 10111 or via the MySAPSApp.sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.zaCape Argus
