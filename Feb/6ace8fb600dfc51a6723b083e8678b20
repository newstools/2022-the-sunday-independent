When we put our hands up you ignore us…and when one of your people speak you give them ample time while any of us are suppressed.”Another member from Polokwane said Sibanda-Kekana had proven herself as treasurer for the region and could manage the Province’s money.“Every branch in the region now has a bank account because of her (Sibanda-Kekana). It is unheard of and proves a point,” he said.The meeting collapsed when Mpe asked the delegates to vote between Selamolela and Sibanda-Kekana those that supported Selamolela walked out of the meeting  a scuffle ensued.Therefore the RGC  resolved to nominate Sibanda-KekanaPretoria News
