OUR infrastructure in virtually every sector of our economy is disintegrating at an alarming pace, with no intervention in sight from the powers that be.The ANC of 1922 has failed the country, betrayed the masses who over the past 25 years remained loyal and steadfast to a party that was led by political giants. Over the past 15 years the ANC became a party of the elite for the elite in the interests of the elite.Wise strategists have already prepared its obituary, for when it dies of massive political cardiac seizure in 2024. When that occurs, there will be seismic shock waves that will devastate the political landscape of the country. Its after-effects will be frightening as uncertainty pulverises the nation.Political resuscitation will not revive a terminally stricken party as it heads towards the ash heap of history. In 2024, the world will awake to a new reality whose consequences will be felt across the length and breadth of Southern Africa.Any return to a trustworthy governance system across the political landscape will require a Herculean leadership. Our past politics, far from being stable platforms, have proven to be nebulous entities that can be set up, merged with others, slit, resurrected, regurgitated, reconstructed, renamed, repackaged, recycled or flushed down the toilet any time.We are an exploited people swimming aimlessly in abject poverty, while the elite and their ilk dine in wine in absolute luxury. In an era of instant and mass communications, the masses have noted the critical imbalance in our greed-driven society. Their response in 2024 will shake the foundations of this nation to its core. A political volcano is simmering beneath the surface, gathering momentum, as poverty widens into a frightening trajectory, crime escalates into a bloody frenzy, unemployment reels out of control, and corruption has become de facto state policy.This is a recipe for a disaster of epic proportions that no force on Earth will be able to control.Time has run out, we are at the mercy of the approaching storm. Pray, pray hard, for our beloved country.FAROUK ARAIE | JohannesburgDaily News
