CAPE TOWN - Rhodes University PhD student Aviwe Matiwane along with six other researchers has shown how colonial history and global economics distort the understanding of deep-time biodiversity, in an article published in the Nature Ecology & Evolution journal.“Fossils provide an important record of how life on Earth has evolved and adapted to changing environments,” Matiwane said. “However, the fossil record is incomplete and uneven, with strong biases towards certain global regions such as North America and Europe. These spatial biases are not only due to physical factors but also to historical and socio- economic factors related to colonialism.”In the study, the researchers explore how scientific colonialism and socio-economic factors, such as gross domestic product (GDP), education, security, and English proficiency, affect the global distribution of fossil data."We used scientific publication and geographic data from the Paleobiology Database to investigate past biodiversity patterns. We found that a staggering 97% of palaeontological data is generated by researchers based in countries in Northern America and Western Europe,” Matiwane explained.According to Matiwane, many of these affluent countries also conduct a large amount of research abroad, often without collaboration with local researchers in the countries they are working in.“This is a clear demonstration of ‘parachute science,’ where lower- income countries are exploited for their fossils and palaeontological data, but the higher- income countries retain the knowledge and power,” she said.Matiwane said that if these global disparities in palaeontology were to be alleviated and more ethical and equitable research conducted, decolonisation needed to occur, and researchers should adopt more inclusive research practices.Based on the study’s findings, the researchers have encouraged the palaeontological community to develop more equitable, ethical, and sustainable collaborations based on mutual trust and respect that centre local people’s needs and research interests and seek funding schemes that develop equitable global partnerships between resource-rich countries and local communities in lower-income countries.They have also encouraged increased access to palaeontological knowledge, particularly for lower-income countries, through repatriation of fossil specimens to their countries of origin, more open-access publishing options, and investing in institutions in lower-income countries so that they can manage and protect their fossils locally.“These are some suggestions that could help improve the challenges in our field,” Matiwane explained. “Countries like South Africa have strict heritage laws that protect it against parachute science. We hope that our research can initiate discussions around these practices, leading to tangible solutions.”The research article is the first to be translated and published in isiXhosa by the journal.Cape Times
