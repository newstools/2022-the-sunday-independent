CAPE TOWN - Organisations working with homeless people have expressed optimism at what appears to be the City’s change in approach away from relying only on punitive measures when dealing with the homeless.This after mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said he had written to the Provincial Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to request the drafting of a protocol under the Intergovernmental Relations Framework Act that would see more psychiatric treatment and addiction programme referrals where needed.The amended Streets, Public Places and the Prevention of Noise Nuisances by-law, the amendments to which are now gazetted and are law, now uniquely requires that alternative accommodation be offered, and ensures that sleeping and camping overnight in public places is no longer classified as an automatic offence if no other choice is available to a person.The City says the amendments effectively decriminalise this conduct where no alternative is available while still ensuring that every intervention of the City is oriented towards assisting people to move off the streets.Only after the refusal of offers of shelter and social assistance will the law take its course.Hill-Lewis said: “Cape Town must be, first and foremost, a caring city that always tries first to help people off the streets. No person should live on the streets. This is unsafe, unhealthy and undignified. Accepting sustainable solutions off the streets is the best choice for dignity, health and well-being. Our city’s public places serve important social, community and economic purposes, and must be open and available to all. No person has the right to reserve a public space as exclusively theirs while indefinitely refusing all offers of shelter and social assistance.“It is not an offence to sleep on the streets if you do not have a choice. Only after refusing offers of shelter and social assistance should the law take its course as a necessary last resort deterrent for the sustainable management of public places and courts, and prosecutors must ensure that rehabilitation is favoured over punitive fines and imprisonment wherever it is just to do so in matters relating to prohibited conduct in public places,” said Hill-Lewis.Non-profit organisation (NPO) U-turn said there was still considerable work needed to help reduce the number of people stranded on the streets.U-turn spokesperson Rowen Ravera-Bauer said: “Homelessness is a solvable problem that requires a collective effort to ensure responsible giving that directs individuals into developmental and rehabilitation programmes. There is considerable expertise within the City with effective programmes with which the City is able to partner. We call on the City to be more strategic in supporting long-term rehabilitative solutions, conscious that punitive responses have proven historically to be ineffective, costly and counter-productive.”Cape Times
