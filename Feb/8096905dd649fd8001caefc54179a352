DURBAN - The National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) described the poaching of rhinos for their horn as “barbaric and groundless”.The NSPCA was reacting to the increase in rhino poaching in South Africa in 2021 as compared to 2020 and recent years.The NSPCA said international trade in rhino horn was banned under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora."An increasing insatiable demand for rhino horn in the last decade has resulted in unprecedented levels of poaching that is plunging rhino populations into crisis. South Africa holds the majority of the world’s rhinos and bears the brunt of the continent’s rhino poaching, with more than 1 000 rhinos killed each year between 2013 and 2017," the NSPCA said.Citing statistics from the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE) last week on rhino poaching in South Africa in 2021, the department said a total of 451 rhino were poached in South Africa in 2021. While a marked decline in rhino poaching in the Kruger National Park has been observed, due to an increase in intensity of anti-poaching activities, poaching syndicates have re-directed efforts to easy targets, resulting in an increase of poaching on private reserves in Limpopo and Mpumalanga.MORE ON THISMore rhinos poached in the first six months of 2021 than the last six451 rhinos were poached in 2021 says the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the EnvironmentInterpol’s eight-week operation against wildlife crime and trafficking yields arrests and seizures across Asia and AfricaAlmost 900kgs of South African rhino horns destined for Asian countries seized between 2014 and 2021How South Africa is tackling rhino poaching and rhino horn traffickingDFFE further said that in 2021, 189 arrests were made in connection to poaching activities. The courts handed down 38 verdicts and 37 cases resulted in the conviction of 61 accused rhino poachers."The NSPCA views the ongoing poaching of iconic species such as rhino for their horn as barbaric and groundless for its presumed medicinal properties and status symbol of success. It is a disgraceful and an undeserving crime against rhino as a species, the important role they fulfil in natural ecosystems and against a South African natural treasure."The NSPCA commends the work and commitment of government, the private sector, relevant non-governmental organisations, rangers and all role players in the continued efforts in safeguarding South Africa’s rhino populations and to combat wildlife crime," it said.The NSPCA encouraged people to report wildlife crimes.The public can report any suspicious activities around wildlife to the environmental crime hotline which is 0800 205 005 or the SAPS number 10111.Daily News
