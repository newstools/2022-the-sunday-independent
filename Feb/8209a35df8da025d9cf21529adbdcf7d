CAPE TOWN - Almost two years after Africa identified its first case of COVID-19, the World Health Organisation (WHO) finds that, if current trends continue, the continent can control the pandemic in 2022.However, WHO warned that continued vigilance is key.Over the last two years, the continent has witnessed four waves of COVID-19, each with higher peaks or more total new cases than the previous one. Each subsequent wave has triggered a response that has been more effective than the previous, with each surge shorter by 23% on average from the one before. While the first wave lasted about 29 weeks, the fourth wave was over in six weeks, or about a fifth of the time.“Over the past two years, the African continent has gotten smarter, faster and better at responding to each new surge in cases of COVID-19,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.“Against the odds, including huge inequities in access to vaccination, we’ve weathered the COVID-19 storm with resilience and determination, informed by Africa’s long history and experience with controlling outbreaks. But COVID-19 has cost us dearly, with more than 242 000 lives lost and tremendous damage to our economies.”“Although COVID-19 will be with us for the long-term, there is light at the end of the tunnel. This year we can end the disruption and destruction the virus has left in its path, and gain back control over our lives,” added Moeti.When Africa experienced its first wave,the average case fatality ratio (CFR)—or the proportion of infected people who die from COVID-19—was at 2.5%. That figure rose to 2.7% during the Beta-driven second wave, before going back down to 2.4% during the Delta-powered third wave. In contrast, the average CFR during the fourth wave is at 0.8%, representing the first time a wave’s surge in cases has not led to a commensurate increase in hospitalisations and deaths.Since the start of the pandemic, the continent’s capacity to manage COVID-19 cases has gradually improved, with the increased availability of trained health workers, oxygen and other medical supplies. The number of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds has increased across the continent, from 8 per 1 million people in 2020 to 20 today. Oxygen availability, however, remains a concern, and a large majority of patients who require oxygen as part of their clinical treatment plan are unable to access it.“As we enter this new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we must use the lessons learned over the past two years to strengthen our continent’s health systems so that we are better prepared to handle future waves of the disease,” said Moeti. “Since new variants have fueled waves, it is critical that countries strengthen their capacity to detect them through improved genome sequencing. This will also ensure we spot other deadly viruses swiftly.”WHO has increased the number of laboratories able to detect COVID-19 from two to more than 900 today, and is bolstering genetic sequencing efforts in Africa through initiatives including the Regional Centre of Excellence for Genomic Surveillance and Bioinformatics in South Africa in collaboration with South African National Bioinformatics Institute (SANBI) at the University of Western Cape.To date, around 672 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been received in Africa, of which 65% were facilitated by COVAX, 29% via bilateral deals and 6% through the African Union’s Vaccines Acquisition Trust.Cape Times
