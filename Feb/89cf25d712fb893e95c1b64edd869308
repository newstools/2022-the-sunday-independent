CAPE TOWN - The number of permits issued by the City of Cape Town’s Events Permit Office have more than doubled over the last seven months compared to the previous year, with the easing of lockdown regulations contributing to the sharp increase.In a statement, the City said the Events Permit Office has issued 191 event permits between July and December of the 2021/22 financial year.This is in stark contrast to the 2020/21 financial year when the office only issued 91 event permits.The City said the low numbers in the previous financial year can be attributed to the national state of disaster restrictions on gatherings, which also forced the cancellation of many events.The Events Permit Office has, meanwhile, also issued 30 non-compliance letters, with 25 in the last three months. The letters are issued to organisers who did not provide the necessary documents timeously and whose proposed events failed to meet the safety requirements.“During this financial year, we have hosted major events such as the Cape Town Cycle Tour, SANLAM Cape Town Marathon and Miss South Africa, among others. “This shows that there is appetite from organisers as well as those who attend to return to having events full time in order to further stimulate the economy,”  said safety and security mayco member JP Smith.“While we support the full time return of events, it is also important that safety at events and Covid-19 compliance remains a priority. We would like to remind event organisers to ensure that they follow all legislative requirements and work with the Events Permit Office to ensure events are Covid-compliant,” said Smith.For an event permit approval, it is important that event organisers produce a detailed medical plans or confirmation from a medical service provider to undertake this work, detailed security plans, a vendor layout plan and certificates of acceptability for food vendor, emergency evacuation plans, confirmation of an appropriate public liability insurance and a SAPS Risk Grading Certificate.Cape Times
