DURBAN - THE National Freedom Party (NFP) has called for Zulu King Misuzulu kaZwelithini to be granted a platform to address the province during the opening of the KwaZulu-Natal legislature next week.The call comes as the KZN Legislature gets ready to host the State Of the Province Address (Sopa) to be delivered by Premier Sihle Zikalala next Thursday. The NFP said its call was in line with its appreciation and support for traditional leadership as an important pillar of society.It has been customary in KZN for the legislature opening to be held over two days, with the first day reserved for the address by the Zulu king, and the second for the Sopa.However, this year things are more complex as while Misuzulu is the de facto king, his succession to the throne is being challenged by other members of the royal family.The NFP said: “The king must be given a platform to address his nation through the KwaZulu-Natal Sopa, and they must allow him to follow in his father’s footsteps.”MORE ON THISPremier’s office says bills have been paid for king’s palaceZulu royal rebels drop Prince Simakade in contest for the Zulu throneWe are battle ready, says king Misuzulu’s legal team, ‘royal rebels’ urged to think twice after failed interdict attemptKing Misuzulu addresses Isandlwana commemoration after bid to interdict it failedThe IFP yesterday expressed its displeasure at the government’s apparent decision to not allow King Misuzulu to address his subjects to mark the start of the activities of the KZN Legislature.“We are appalled by the decision in which the descendent of King Shaka kaSenzangakhona is silenced,” IFP MPL Blessed Gwala said yesterday.The KZN Legislature Speaker said yesterday that a press conference would be held on Tuesday to clarify information about the Sopa, including the matter of the king’s address.Another issue affecting the Zulu royal household this week came on Wednesday during a government lekgotla, when it emerged that the Zululand District Municipality had disconnected the water supply at KwaKhangelamankengane Palace over an unpaid R1.7 million water bill.The palace was the home of Misuzulu’s mother, the late Queen Mantfombi Dlamini-Zulu.Zululand district mayor Thulasizwe Buthelezi, who was at the lekgotla, accused the provincial government of reneging on its commitment to pay for the services rendered by the district to the palace.“It is very strange that the provincial government has paid the water account for all other palaces except KwaKhangelamankengane Palace. It is clear that the premier wants to humiliate the king and his household by forcing the municipality to disconnect water supply for services not paid for,” said Buthelezi.Provincial government spokesperson Lennox Mabaso dismissed the allegation and accused the mayor of grandstanding at the expense of the royal household.“As the provincial government of KwaZulu-Natal, we wish to set the record straight.“There is no truth in the assertions that water bills related to KwaKhangelamankengane Royal Palace are not being paid,” said Mabaso.He added that both the provincial and national governments were looking into a plan to ensure that in future, royal palaces were not subjected to any form of abuse in the form of the supply of services.THE MERCURY
