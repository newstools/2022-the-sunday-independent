DURBAN - TEACHERS fighting, overcrowded classrooms and an allegation that R500 000 was embezzled from its coffers are among the problems at a northern KwaZulu-Natal school.This emerged during a visit to the school by the education portfolio committee at the weekend.The committee visited KwaNogcoyi Primary School after one of the committee members, IFP MPL Thembeni KaMadlopha Mthethwa, highlighted the issues.It is one of two schools visited by the committee because of many challenges.Committee members said they left the school fearing that the fighting could deprive the pupils of the necessary foundational education they needed to cope with the demands of high school as they were told that the school lacked a “good classroom environment”.MORE ON THISTeachers have allegedly assaulted each other in front of pupils at a school in ZululandKZN Education Department says it's dealing with the matter where teachers allegedly fight amongst themselves in front of pupilsThe primary school has more than 1 000 pupils and a full complement of teachers.Among the allegations was that there had been a physical confrontation between teachers in front of the young pupils at the school.“There are allegations that still need to be tested – that R500 000 was embezzled from the school funds.“The embezzlement does not mean the money was withdrawn from the school account but it could be that a service provider was overpaid for a service, but at the moment that is still an allegation that needs to be tested,” DA MPL and its Education spokesperson Dr Imran Keeka said.He said they were briefed by the school’s acting principal on the issues, including fighting among staff members. “We fear that could create problems including absenteeism that will deny the children a learning opportunity. It was not clear what was causing the infighting and we have asked for the matter to be probed,” Keeka said.“The school management said there was no good class environment, which means that the pupils are not learning well and might be deprived of the key skills like reading and writing and reading for understanding, skills that they would need at high school.”Besides the challenges with staff, they also found that the school has serious infrastructure challenges as it was overcrowded with three pupils sharing a desk.Mthethwa said the problems at the school were quite serious.“The divisions between teachers are deep, we learnt that some have taken each other to court, so the learning environment is just not there,” she said.“There are allegations of corruption, that school monies were misappropriated. The school has been without a school principal since 2018.“After that principal left, a new one was brought in and that one resigned after a few months.“The current one has been acting since September and told the committee that it was very difficult to work at that school.“We know that these problems have been ongoing since 2019 and the department has compiled a report on the problems there. We are just concerned why they have not acted on their report.”The divisions between teachers were so entrenched that members of the school governing body had told the community they wanted all the teachers at the school to be re-assigned and new teachers brought in, she said.KZN Department of Education spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi said they were aware of the committee’s visit to the school.He said some of the issues that the committee had been alerted to were being attended to by the department.THE MERCURY
