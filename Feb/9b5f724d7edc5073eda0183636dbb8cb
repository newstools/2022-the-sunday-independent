CAPE TOWN - The City's Public Emergency Call Centre (PECC) and the Western Cape Government Emergency Medical Services (EMS) have integrated their technical systems to improve the manner in which emergency medical incidents are shared between the two entities.For many years, the City’s PECC received telephone calls from people in need of emergency medical services. The City does not provide ambulance services as this is a provincial function, and therefore the incident details still had to be transferred to the EMS Call Centre, via 10177.“The PECC currently answers over 500 000 calls per annum, of which 49% are medically related. Often these calls have to be redirected, but telling the caller to dial 10177 themselves, especially while they are in a stressful and possibly life-threatening situation, is not the most efficient solution,” Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said.The PECC and the City had adopted a strategy where the 107 operator registers the incident details from the caller and then traditionally, the operator would then either hand the details over to the EMS Call Centre, or conference the call to the EMS Call Centre depending on the specific situation.Both the City of Cape Town and the Western Cape government’s EMS have advanced computer-aided dispatch technology solutions, but they are different systems and required a dedicated project to integrate the two systems from both a technical perspective, and from a data structure perspective."The City and province have made a decision to embark on the integration project in order to leverage the technology in order to improve the registration and sharing of emergency medical incidents in the city. The purpose of the project was to ensure that when a service request was logged on the City’s EPIC (Emergency Policing Incident Command) system, that at the touch of a button, the details could be shared with EMS instantly and accurately," Smith said.The City explained that this would cut out the requirement to “recapture” the details and allows for the service request to be immediately viewed and entered into the priority queuing process within the EMS system.Additionally, the systems continue to communicate so that the status of the EMS response can be seen by the City PECC 107 operator.This saves an additional call to 10177 in order to enquire about the status of an ambulance.The project was completed late last year and went live on November 9.  To date over 25 000 incidents have been transferred electronically from the City to the Western Cape government’s EMS Call Centre.Cape Times
