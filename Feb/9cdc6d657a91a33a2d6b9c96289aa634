Cape Town - Youth activists from Cape Town gathered over the weekend to delve deeper into climate change and the way it directly affects their communities.The gathering was organised by African Climate Alliance (ACA) and Project 90 by 2030, to discuss ways of applying an intersectional approach to climate change and to interrogate ways of sharing information from a westernised view. Youth development manager, Daniel Robinson said: “This was an opportunity for youth activists to build their understanding of how they can use the intersectionality framework in addressing climate change in their community.“Many of the participants were from different areas of Cape Town and were able to listen to others who share their same understanding, as well as challenge their own understanding of climate change and climate justice,” Robinson said.The dialogue dealt with how social, economic and environment issues such as racism, sexism, unequal education and poverty, converge with climate change.ACA youth coordinator, Gabriel Klaasen said: “People have different areas of priority, which comes with different approaches to the ways that we build understanding and knowledge, share that and take action. “It’s important to address it that way, otherwise we find ourselves only targeting a certain audience rather than everyone who needs to be involved.“For generations youth have been the call for change and now we see the build up of young people again calling for a world that they want defined by justice. Different generations have different approaches and so it’s important to acknowledge that those approaches are not necessarily going to work for another generation but it remains crucial to see the value in both,” Klaasen said.The dialogue is part of a greater initiative by Project 90 by 2030 which seeks to co-create afro-centric climate knowledge and resources for young South Africans.
