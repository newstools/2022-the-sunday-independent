CAPE TOWN - Animal welfare organisation Four Paws, is preparing to embark on an exciting mission to rescue a family of tigers abandoned on a train carriage in Argentina, South America and relocate them to a wildlife sanctuary in the Free State Province.A travelling circus allegedly abandoned a now 18-year-old male and 15-year-old female tiger in 2007, asking a local farmer to take care of them temporarily, but apparently never returned.The tigers have since become a family of four.According to Four Paws, the private keeping of wild animals is illegal in Argentina and the farmer who took care of the tigers did not inform the authorities immediately.When representatives of the responsible wildlife authority, Fauna San Luis, encountered the poor living conditions of the big cats during an inspection visit in 2021, they began looking for solutions, knowing they could not rehome the tigers locally.“The train carriage was filthy with excrement and leftover meat and bones for a long time but fortunately, this is not the case anymore. Tigers need to move, run, play, and bathe. Being locked in a 75m² train carriage and only pacing back and forth for 15 years is not a tiger-worthy life. All those years in such a small space have affected their mental and physical wellbeing for sure. We have a window of opportunity now to rescue them, and we will,” said Four Paws veterinarian Dr Amir Khalil, who will lead the rescue mission.The Four Paws team will travel in the coming weeks on the invitation of the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development to examine the tigers and transfer them to Lionsrock Big Cat Sanctuary in Bethlehem, Free State.Four Paws chief executive Josef Pfabigan said by rescuing the tigers in Argentina, they can provide a better life for them individually and create awareness for all animals globally to be treated with respect, empathy and understanding.Cape Times
