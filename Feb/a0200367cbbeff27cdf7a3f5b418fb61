CAPE TOWN - An Elsies River pensioner has appealed to the public to help keep her soup kitchen open.Katriena Barle, who is 64, started her NPO, Cathy Helping Hands, in 2019 and has been feeding her community from her home and pension ever since.She said her motivation for the initiative was to keep children off the streets and now to assist families who had suffered as a result of job losses due to Covid-19."I enjoy giving the children food. Just to see the smiles on their faces warms my heart. I'm currently using my pension money to buy food and provide, but I do it because I enjoy it," said Barle.She operates her soup kitchen on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and said her main focus was to feed children and elderly people.She also hosts various activities at her home, including dance classes for children."I dish up at 3pm when the children come out of school, and for the elderly who are not able to come get food, I take it to them," she said.Barle’s daughter, Angeline Hendricks, said she helped her mom where she could, and sometimes they relied on family and friends for basic ingredients."In this community, the people are really struggling and the children are so thankful for that meal they receive when they come home from school," said Hendricks.To assist Cathy Helping Hands, contact angelinehendricks@hotmail.com.Cape Times
