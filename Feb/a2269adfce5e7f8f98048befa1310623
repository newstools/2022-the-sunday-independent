CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town is marginalising coloured people and their culture in favour of profit and white-owned business, the Cape Coloured Congress (CCC) said following the treatment of the attendees at an annual Cape Minstrel event on Sunday.The CCC said they viewed the methods employed by law enforcement at the Bo-Kaap “nagtroepe” march with concern and dismay.“Clearly it seems that there are two sets of rules: they enforce the laws according racial lines. This was evidenced when they used Covid restrictions to break up a centuries-old cultural tradition of the coloured people in Bo-Kaap on Sunday evening. The coloured people in this province were merely celebrating their hundreds of years’ old tradition at a relatively non-alcoholic event. An event that would have brought in much-needed capital to the surrounding Bo-Kaap businesses,” CCC spokesperson Manuel Portela said.These rules were not enforced on “white-owned events and businesses of the city centre,” Portela said.“White-owned businesses may cordon off streets and revel in alcoholic trading, flaunting Covid rules in clear view of the same law enforcement. This is evidenced in the bars and clubs of Long Street as well.”The CCC said they would be watching the upcoming Cape Town Cycle Tour with “keen interest", and if the event goes ahead under current Covid restrictions with the more than 20 000 participants, they will demand that the annual Minstrel Carnival go ahead with 18 000 people.The City meanwhile said it had consistently issued fines for Covid-19 violations.“The City has consistently issued fines for violations of Covid-19 lockdown regulations as per the national Disaster Management Act (DMA). Enforcement should also include focusing on venue and event owners to ensure that all relevant legislation are adhered to,” member of the mayoral committee for safety and security JP Smith said.Many event organisers were also splitting their events into different components over different days to allow for wider participation, he added.“Organisers of City events should all adhere to the requirements of the Events By-law, the Safety at Sports and Recreational Events Act 2 of 2010 and the national Disaster Management Act with specific reference to the Covid-19 lockdown regulations.”“The Minstrels are treated no differently and they have every year been the recipients of the largest events budget allocation – for the legally approved street marches and competitions,” he said.Smith said events like the Cape Town Cycle Tour are anticipating the cessation of the state of disaster and the accompanying DMA lockdown regulations.Cape Times
