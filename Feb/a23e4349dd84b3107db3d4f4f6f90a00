CAPE TOWN - A Khayelitsha woman, Nongomso Bhontsi, who lost her younger sister in a fire that also claimed the lives of four other people, believes she is alive because of her instinct.The 33-year-old woman had been seated in a shack with her sister Anitha, 25, Sinovuyo Chali, 25, two cousins Mkhululi Thovane, 46 and Nolufefe Zongile, 30, and a 34-year-old man on Thursday night but had to go home.In the early hours of Friday the shack became engulfed by a fire which trapped all five people - they all died.The City’s Fire and Rescue service spokesperson, Jermaine Carelse, said they were alerted at about 1:50am.Although firefighters managed to quickly extinguish the blaze, they came across the bodies of five people who had sustained fatal burn wounds.Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said an inquest case was opened for investigation following the incident that happened in K2 Block, Bemja Street.The cause of the fire was unknown at this stage, Van Wyk said.   Bhontsi said: “The shack was Nolufefe’s, it was rebuilt during the day. Last year it was one of the shacks that was destroyed. We were all keeping her company after assisting to rebuild it because she was afraid of spending the night alone in a shack that had no electricity. They were also celebrating. Around 8pm I left them and went home. I was tired and didn’t feel like staying longer. Early in the morning we were woken up by residents who were calling for help and shouting that it was burning. It is so painful and heartbreaking the way they died. Some bodies were found together in the bed and others on the floor by the door,” she said.Cape Times
