I know sometimes when I refer matters to legal it means I don’t agree with the answer I received. I would like to know whether it was a positive or a negative answer?”Maynier said the minister’s answer contained no substantive response to the dispute and that he had referred the letter to legal services because he wanted to take advice on how to respond.“Because we are in an intergovernmental dispute, I will get advice on how to respond appropriately within the intergovernmental dispute framework,” Maynier saidDuring the briefing, Cape Town Air Access project manager Paul van den Brink said there was some positive news for the Western Cape as United Airlines, which in 2019 started operating direct flights to Cape Town from Newark in New York, would, from June, have three flights a week to Cape Town.The pandemic interrupted flights in March 2020 but the airline returned in December last year, and the more frequent schedule is the result of the route doing so well.United Airlines, started operating direct flights from Newark in New York to Cape Town in 2019.
