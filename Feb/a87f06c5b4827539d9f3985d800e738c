CAPE TOWN - When Mushu arrived at TEARS, he had horrific open wounds that had been inflicted on him by his littermates.TEARS first met Mushu when his owners brought the entire litter for vaccination and sterilisation.At that time, the animal welfare organisation strongly urged the owner to separate the litter as they would begin to fight with each other, a symptom of littermate syndrome in dogs.Sadly, the owner did not heed their warning and Mushu, the smallest of the litter, became a target for his siblings’ hard playing and lack of socialisation with other dogs.When Mushu arrived, he was taken to the TEARS Veterinary Hospital and assessed.His wounds were the result of repeated attacks by his littermates for weeks on end.His entire body had wounds of different ages, but the worst of the wounds were on his front legs.Unquestionably, Mushu had been left without veterinary treatment for weeks.The veterinary team began treatment in an effort to help the puppy enjoy a life with kindness.Mushu's wounds were infected and so before any reconstruction could be done, he needed antibiotics to overcome the deep infection that his small body was fighting.With bandaging, pain medications, antibiotics, wound care, physio, exercise and good nutrition thanks to Hill's Pet Nutrition, Mushu started to heal and the wounds began to do better.“Today, Mushu is ready for adoption! He does have scarring on his legs, but he's a very special little sweetheart who bears no ill will towards other dogs. In fact, Mushu loves other dogs! He enjoys outings to the beach and exploring. Mushu would love a house where he can sleep on the bed and be your new forever sidekick. Mushu will be a small pit bull, not only due to being the smallest of his litter, but also because his growth was stunted due to his body fighting to heal,” TEARS said.Visit tears.org.za.Cape Times
