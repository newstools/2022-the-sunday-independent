CAPE TOWN - Kraaifontein residents have appealed for swift police action after the murders of two women at the weekend.It is understood the women were killed in an attempted house robbery on Sunday night.A Bloekombos community leader, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of victimisation, said: “Robberies often happen in our area but this one is different and that could be because the suspects were known by the victims. Two weeks ago a house was robbed in the same street but there was no shooting, they just took two plasma TVs and cell phones.“The community tries by all means to fight crime but the same people who we are trying to protect are the ones who hide information so that makes it difficult for us,” he said.Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said the suspects were yet to be arrested.“Kraaifontein police are investigating a double murder case after a shooting incident on February 13 at 10:45pm in Henzekile Street, Bloekombos, Kraaifontein, where two females, one aged 45 and the other unknown, were shot and fatally wounded.“Circumstances surrounding this incident are under investigation,” said Van Wyk.Meanwhile the family of Bonke Ntantiso, who was shot and killed in Barcelona informal settlement while deejaying at one of the local taverns, say they are in mourning.Ntantiso’s brother Lwazi said: “The incident happened after (we were) watching a soccer match, then my brother gathered his equipment to play music. Just after he played a few songs two strangers came in.“Just after he asked me to put cable wires in order so that they don't get damaged, I heard gunshots and I saw people running out. I followed them. When I went back he was lying down and there was blood all over. The suspects disappeared,” said Lwazi.Police spokesperson Joseph Swartbooi said no arrests had been made.“The circumstances surrounding an incident that occurred at a local tavern at Europa Squatter camp on Saturday are under investigation. Gugulethu police attended the scene and upon arrival they found the body of an unknown man who sustained a gunshot wound to the body. The victim was declared deceased on the scene. The motive for the attack is unknown,” said Swartbooi.Cape Times
