We know that reports related to instances of sexual and gender-based violence can be difficult to hear or read,” Shabalala said.Regarding the block on re-registration for the new academic year which applies to students who have outstanding fee debts of more than R1 000, Shabalala said accumulated student fee debt was an ongoing challenge for UCT, as it was for other universities in South Africa. “The executive is engaged with the SRC in seeking a way forward on this issue.”In a statement on Wednesday, Monoane said he has written to the SRC, and informed the executive that the survivor indicated that he was not involved in the incident.“My name was mentioned in a statement from an unknown Twitter account alleging that I was involved, aware, and or enabled gender-based violence at the university. The statement further stated that a case was opened with the UCT Office of Inclusivity and Change. I would like to reserve all my rights. I will be continuing in my duties as the secretary-general of the SRC of the university,” said Monoane.The SRC did not respond to questions on Wednesday.On Tuesday, SRC acting president Siya Plaatjie in a statement said they were nauseated and disgusted by the allegations against Zibi.“Subsequent to this an urgent meeting was called by the SRC where the SRC was made aware of these grievous sexual violence allegations and alleged abuse of power by Zibi.“It must be noted that in this meeting Zibi stated his refusal to co-operate with the UCT SRC.”Cape Times
