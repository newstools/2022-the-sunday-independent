Cape Town - Rietvlei is the first of the three vleis to be reopened after it was closed in December as a precautionary measure following water quality concerns.Test results released by the City last year showed Rietvlei was the least polluted vlei.However, following its closure in December after a reopening just a month before, the Milnerton Aquatic Club raised concerns about the vlei’s closure, stating that the City was not transparent, with water quality test results used as a rationale to constantly close the vlei.At the time, Milnerton Aquatic Club conversation officer Katja Haslinger said stakeholders were not informed of the levels of E. coli which informed the closure of the vlei, or points where the pollution was discovered.On December 31, January 17 and January 25 the aquatic club conducted independent water testing in the vlei which showed lower levels of E. coli compared to tests conducted by the City.
