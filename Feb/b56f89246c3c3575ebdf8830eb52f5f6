CAPE TOWN - A powerful and iconic mural celebrating the life of ANC activist Dulcie September, who was assassinated in Paris, was unveiled at the Dulcie September Civic Centre in Athlone on Tuesday afternoon.Commissioned by Enver Samuel, the director of the award-winning and much-acclaimed documentary film Murder in Paris, the mural is one of the pillars of a unique impact campaign of the film set up to keep September’s legacy alive.Attended by a number of dignitaries, including Denise Newman who lent her voice to September as a voice over in the film; award-winning journalist, author and activist Zubeida Jaffer; ward councillor Rashid Adams, and pupils from Athlone High School, the mural was unveiled by September’s niece and nephew Nicola and Michael Arendse.   “I knew my aunt just briefly when we were young and she had just come out of prison and she was under house arrest. “She always joked and spoiled us to bits, and one day, she was just gone.“We got to know my aunt through other people and I’m so glad for those recollections. “Being young today isn’t easy and you’re just surrounded by so many influencers and role models…“Here we have a mural that I hope resonates with younger people and I hope that this will inspire you to go research about her,” said Michael.Samuel approached well-known Cape Town-based arts organisation Baz Art, which specialises in street art, for assistance.They recommended and commissioned one of the country’s best and prolific street artists, Dbongz Mahlathi, for the job.Mahlathi did extensive research to get a sense of who Dulcie was, and using spray paint, worked off a photograph of her – completing the moving commission in two days.The Dulcie September Civic Centre in Athlone  was selected as the site for the mural, not only because the centre is named after her, and is a public space, but also because Dulcie grew up in Athlone and went to school at Athlone high.“To a certain extent Dulcie’s legacy has been erased, and the reason for her murder has never been uncovered. “And it is our hope through the documentary film and various impact activations like this, that we can counteract that erasure, and finally gain recognition for her valuable contribution to her Struggle against apartheid,” said Samuel.Samuel said the assassination-murder case of September would be re-opened in France during May later this year.Cape Times
