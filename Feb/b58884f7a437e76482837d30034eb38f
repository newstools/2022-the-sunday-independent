CAPE TOWN - The first ever laughing gull has been recorded in South Africa, after being spotted in Mossel Bay earlier this month.The bird has never been recorded south of the Equator on the African continent before.Avid birder Don Reid said he spotted the gull on February 6 when he went for a swim at the beach in Mossel Bay at around 6pm.“As I was walking to the beach, I probably saw a dozen gulls in a freshwater pond right on the beach itself. Just looking at the gulls, one of them stuck out like a sore thumb. It had a pitch black head, and I stopped in my tracks and thought this was something very different.“It is all a bit unreal and I did not expect something like that. It happens once in a lifetime, not even for many birders. I’m still trying to work out why I was the one to spot it but it’s being at the right place at the right time,” said Reid.He said he has been interested in birdlife for 35 years and does Atlasing, which is a formal recording of birds. This information gets sent to UCT.SA Rare Birds chair Trevor Hardaker helped Reid to confirm the identity of the bird.Hardaker said the laughing gull is commonly found in South and North America but not in South Africa, thus making this the first recorded bird of its kind in the country.“It was very exciting. A lot of people travelled all over the country to come see the bird. It was found the Sunday afternoon until the following Saturday.“It was only one bird that was found and never seen again, which is a very unlikely scenario, and even more unlikely that we will find one again in South Africa,” said Hardaker.He added that the laughing gull got its name from its laugh-like call.The species is easy to identify at 36 to 41cm long, with a 98 to 110cm wingspan and a weight range of 203 to 371g.The adult’s body is white apart from its dark grey back and wings and black head. Its wings are much darker grey than all other gulls of similar size except the smaller Franklin’s gull, and they have black tips without the white crescent shown by Franklin’s.The beak is long and red. The black hood is mostly lost in winter.Laughing gulls take three years to reach adult plumage.Cape Times
