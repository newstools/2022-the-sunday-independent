CAPE TOWN - Universities in the Western Cape say they’re ready to kick off the academic year on Monday with UCT particularly excited as teaching and learning will take place in-person for all faculties.Learning for millions of tertiary students has been conducted online for the past two years, owing to Covid-19 pandemic. Last week institutions concluded their orientation and registration.“This new year is particularly significant, as UCT begins the return to on-campus face-to-face engagement after two years of unprecedented disruption to learning and teaching. “Hundreds of the university staff, across all faculties and support departments, have been working flat out to make this new term, and face-to-face learning, a possibility within the continuing public health requirements that are essential to keep us safe,” said UCT spokesperson Nombuso Shabalala.She said the university’s vaccine mandate panel continues to hold consultative sessions on the draft vaccine mandate policy.“The draft policy provides for staff and students to apply for an exemption to the vaccine mandate on narrow medical grounds and on grounds of sincerely and intensely held beliefs grounded in religion or conscience,” said Shabalala.UWC's Nashira Davids said they have extended registration to February 17.“This is to accommodate students who have not been able to register yet. “Registration will continue online via the student portal and e-advising platforms. “Online consultations, virtual curriculum advising services, and in-person curriculum advising will also continue. “Introductory lectures will be available on the learning management platform,” she said.According to Davids a hybrid approach will be followed, in certain faculties including the Faculty of Dentistry, students will be required to be vaccinated and classes will be face to face.“These classes will adhere to all safety requirements and regulations. “Flexible online learning and teaching will continue in most faculties for 2022.“The university engaged stakeholders and consulted experts on the risks associated with the Covid-19 virus and with regard to vaccine safety.”Davids said in terms of the interim policy, all staff and students will have to be vaccinated in order to enter campus or attend university events.“Unvaccinated students will not be allowed to attend classes on campus, however, as indicated, flexible online learning and teaching will continue in most faculties,” she said.Stellenbosch University (SU) spokesperson, Martin Viljoen, said registration was still ongoing and the university will be continuing with augmented remote teaching learning and assessment  for the first semester of 2022.“This is a flexible hybrid mode of learning and teaching.”Martin said SU’s council still has to have a final say about mandatory vaccination and a recommendation is to be tabled at its first meeting of the year, which is expected on April 11.Cape Peninsula University of Technology spokesperson Lauren Kansley said classes have begun for returning students.“First years are due to start on February 21.
