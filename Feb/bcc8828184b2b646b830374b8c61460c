CAPE TOWN - The principal of Milnerton High School in the Western Cape, Paul Besener, has defended the instruction given to a black learner to bow to his white peer, saying this is a way of apologising and racism  is not considered a factor in this instance.At the same time, learners at Jan Viljoen High School in Gauteng were divided following allegations of racism against black pupils leading to clashes between parents yesterday.MPs are fuming over reports that the Milnerton pupil was made to bow several times to a white pupil following an altercation over a school bench during their school interval.“It is extremely shocking and disgusting to learn about incidents of this nature taking place at schools that are supposed to be places where seeds of non-racialism and non-sexism are sowed. “The committee condemns this alleged humiliation in the strongest terms and it should also be condemned by all at Milnerton High,” the chairperson of the select committee on education and technology, sports, arts and culture, Elleck Nchabeleng, said.But Besener says the bowing act was an instruction initiated by a member of the senior management team as an apology intervention between the two pupils.“The learner, who is allegedly the victim, sustained some physical injury. In order to de-escalate the matter a member of the senior management team intervened to get an apology from the alleged perpetrator (black pupil) to the alleged victim (white pupil).“The management of this apology was over-zealous. Issues of judgement are at stake here, and have been reported to the Western Cape Education Department for investigation. Proper consideration will reveal the objective truth. Speculation is unhelpful.“Milnerton High School is probably the most culturally diverse school in South Africa. We currently have learners of 37 mother tongues enrolled, so that any conflict is likely to cross cultural lines. “A conflict between two boys competing for the same seating during break arose on February 8. This conflict and allegations of argument and head-butting are currently subject to the school’s disciplinary process. Racism is not currently a consideration in this matter,” Besener said.The school governing body has been given full details of the incident and an investigation by the provincial Education Department will “determine the way forward”.Western Cape Education Department (WCED) spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said the allegations were serious and being treated as such.“The matter was reported to Labour Relations and an investigation is under way. The school dealt with the matter according to WCED policy and protocols.”SA Human Rights Commission spokesperson Andre Gaum said they were aware of the incident and were looking into the matter.“We will assess it to decide on the possible investigation thereof,” Gaum said.The tensions in Jan Viljoen High School Randfontein, which Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited yesterday, were sparked by allegations of racism towards black learners, who were allegedly chased by white learners, apparently over a spot under a tree.A Grade 8 learner and some of his friends started dancing under a tree that some of the white learners claimed was their territory.According to one of the head girls at the school, Naledi Zondo, the group of white learners were further infuriated that the black learner was doing the Umlando dance and singing along to the amapiano song on a speaker.“The white guys thought he was insulting them because of the way he was dancing and they then started chasing him to beat him down,” Zondo said.She said she also got involved in the brawl because she had tried to shield the Grade 8 learner who was trying to hide behind her.Another learner, Esona Madikizela, recounted her ordeal, saying she had been pushed around in the school corridors and told that she did not belong there.“We are tired of this. I am now in matric so we are now fighting for the new kids so that they do not go through what we went through,” Madikizela said.Some of the black prefects at the school said they would not wear their prefect uniform until the school dealt with the racial tensions.The Cape Times’ sister publication, The Star approached some of the parents of the white learners for comment, but most of them seemed upset and declined to speak.Meanwhile, the parents of the black learners said they had formed a WhatsApp group and had decided that their children would not go to class until the Department of Education intervened.Some of them even called for the school’s name to be changed to reflect transformation.A parent, Teddy Mokobane, said he had to fetch his child last Friday after he was told that black and white children were throwing stones at each other.“There are deep issues at this school and they have been there for years for me. The problem is that while the department is taking time with a solution our kids are missing out on school,” Mokobane said.Lesufi  said: “I don’t want to use the word ’shock’, but I am hugely disappointed, but we will sort it out.“Racism and other forms of discrimination should be eliminated. The incident at the school reflects deep-seated racist attitudes in our schools and community.“We must grasp this opportunity to ensure that the school is fully transformed and is a safe and welcoming space for all people regardless of their race, class or religion. We appeal to everyone to give this process an opportunity and not incite violence,” Lesufi said.Cape Times
