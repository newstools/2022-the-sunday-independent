DURBAN - Inanda ward 54 residents are living in fear over the release of all six people accused in the killing of three women in a drive-by shooting before the local government elections last year.On Friday, the ward’s councillors, Themba Mnguni and Nomthandazo Mbeje, made their second appearance for a bail application at the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court.They are charged with the murder of Beatrice Nzama, Ncamisile Shange and Philisiwe Jili in September 2021. Additionally, they face five counts of attempted murder and a charge of conspiracy to commit public violence.The pair were granted bail of R5 000 each, on condition that they do not interfere with witnesses; report twice a week to a local police station; hand in to the police their passports; and relocate out of the area.The other suspects in the case, Sibongile Buthelezi, Samukelisiwe Maphumulo, Thembinkosi Mkhwanazi and Siyabonga Lundy were all granted bail last month.MORE ON THISANC ward councillor appears in court on charges of murder for the three Inanda women killed in a drive-by shooting ahead of the electionsOutcry as suspects accused of killing three women in Inanda drive-by shooting before the local government elections get bailBoyfriend of one of the three women killed in Inanda during an ANC councillor nomination meeting tells of his fearPolitical killings task team hot on trail of Inanda drive-by killersInanda families speak of anguish of drive-by shootingMnguni, the community alleges, is the mastermind behind the murders, as his seat for councillorship was being contested closely in the municipal elections. Resident Mzomusha Zungu said that in spite of the disappointing outcome of the bail applications, as a community, their hopes were not dashed after it was revealed that the court case would be referred to the Durban High Court.He said he believed the referral of the case would ensure there was no attempt to influence court proceedings.“We are very uneasy as a community, and disappointed that they were all granted bail. The fear here, as the entire community protested against the suspects, is palpable.“But, we are very hopeful that the strict bail conditions will keep them, especially the councillor, away from the community. The case being moved to the Durban High Court will also guarantee an objective process, where the judges will be free from bribery and other influences.“Our worries are far from over, though. We live in an area that needs a lot of service delivery and we have been without a councillor now for a month. Leaders in government need to take this seriously,” said Zungu.Sandile Chiliza, an ANC member in the ward, said the ANC continued to distance itself from the case, even though the killings happened at an ANC-sanctioned event.“The first arrest happened in December 2021, and the first appearance was early in January this year.“However, there has never been a representative from the ANC who has come to support the community during such a difficult time.“We are not happy with the ANC’s lack of involvement in the case. The people were killed at an ANC event, they were ANC members, and those who are accused of the murders are also ANC members.“It feels like the ANC is not taking this case seriously. The only time we see them speak about the case is to the media in the comfort of their homes and offices.“Also, they had promised to support the families through counselling and food parcels.“The party has done none of that since the funerals,” said Chiliza.Daily News
