CAPE TOWN- An unregistered locum doctor is expected to appear in the Stellenbosch Magistrate’s Court on Friday, while the medical practitioner who is alleged to have employed him for about three months faces misconduct charges.Felix Yuma, 45, was arrested on Tuesday after the Health Professions Council of South Africa’s (HPCSA) Inspectorate Office conducted an inspection at the practice where he was working.The arrest came a day after the council's inspectors nabbed two locum doctors who were allegedly practising in Delft without having registered with the HPCSA.The medical practitioners who employed them are also facing misconduct charges.The HPCSA’s head of corporate affairs, Christopher Tsatsawane, said Yuma, a Congolese citizen, was not registered with the council, yet was practising as a medical practitioner.He had been employed at the facility since November.Yuma was arrested and detained at the Stellenbosch police station for contravention of the Health Professions Act. The medical practitioner who hired him would be reported to the Medical and Dental Professions Board for misconduct, said Tsatsawane.He urged residents to consult reputable health-care professionals whose credibility was known in their areas.“In cases of new practitioners, the public is advised to check their status with the HPCSA to ascertain the health-care professional’s authenticity.” All health-care practitioners registered with the HPCSA are issued with practising cards. “The practising card contains personal information of the health-care professional concerned and patients have a right to request to see the card before any consultation commences,” said Tsatsawane.Cape Times
