DURBAN - The IFP in the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature has questioned why the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is not pursuing charges against government officials implicated in the multimillion-rand procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) and blankets in the Department of Social Development.IFP Member of Provincial Legislature (MPL) and spokesperson on Social Development, Les Govender, said they were shocked and disappointed with the news that the NPA had decided not to prosecute senior officials in the department.According to the IFP, the senior officials were allegedly implicated in the controversial R22 million procurement of blankets and PPE .“The IFP demands answers as to why the NPA is not proceeding with prosecutions against implicated officials. The IFP is against this ill-conceived decision. This creates the impression that some people are above the law and that there might be political interference involved,”  said Govender.He added that the implicated officials should not be allowed to walk scot free.MORE ON THISOfficials implicated in R22 million blanket saga charged: Minister ZuluCovid-19 blanket suppliers ordered to pay back profitsTwo companies implicated in blanket scandal agree to pay back R1,5m“The forensic report into the irregular procurement found that of the six companies that received contracts for the supply of 12 000 blankets, two companies that quoted approximately R4.8 million have agreed to repay about R1.5 million but we are uncertain as to whether this amount has been repaid. However, two other companies, with quotes of approximately R6 million each, have not agreed to repay anything,” Govender continued.He contended that some of the companies implicated were being protected, arguing that they should also be repaying the department for these heavily inflated quotes.Govender challenged Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza to act on her promise that those responsible for looting would be brought to book.“The MEC must now make good on her commitment and insist that the NPA prosecute all implicated officials. What is the point of instituting a forensic investigation if the findings are not implemented? The companies and officials alleged to have benefited must be prosecuted to send a clear message to others who might have similar intentions,” the MPL insisted.He concluded by saying the IFP will not rest until all those implicated in the controversial and irregular R22 million procurement of blankets and PPE are held accountable.Social Development department spokesperson Mhlaba Memela dismissed suggestions that companies were being protected, insisting that anyone involved in corruption would face the law. “The department has implemented all the recommendations of the forensic investigation. Internal disciplinary hearings in line with the law are still in progress,” said Memela.He stressed that disciplinary steps against fingered individuals was an illustration that the department had not backtracked on its commitment to fight corruption.Asked about the case, the NPA stressed that there must be sufficient evidence in a police docket linking an accused to the commission of an offence.“There was insufficient evidence to link anyone to the commission of the offence, hence the reason for not prosecuting in the matter,“ said Director of Public Prosecutions in KwaZulu-Natal, advocate Elaine Zungu.She said any person that was not satisfied with the decision made should write to the NPA National Office and request that the decision be reviewed.THE MERCURY
