manyane.manyane@inl.co.zaSome University of Johannesburg students are up in arms and on Wednesday members of the EFF Students Command Council embarked on a protest to vent their anger at the institution’s vaccination policy they said violated their constitutional rights.EFF spokesperson Sinawo Tambo described UJ’s stance as draconian, fascist and another abuse of the broadly defined freedoms afforded to institutions of higher learning to operate as states within a state.“Students should consult with their constituencies on a way forward and perhaps take heed from their counterparts in the University of Limpopo and completely disregard these mandates and go to campus,” said Tambo.EFF member of the Auckland Park campus, Khutjo Mnisi, said UJ would kick out students who refused to take a jab, out of the residential centres.“Basically what they are saying is that if you are not vaccinated, you are not eligible to study. “This means you are academically excluded because they say you pose a threat to those who are vaccinated.“They (students) would be taken out despite the fact that they have signed contracts and all of those things. “But no university or company can force someone to take a vaccine because that is basically taking health decisions on behalf of the individuals.“We want the university to allow students to enter campus and study. We feel they did this deliberately when they brought back physical classes because they know everyone would be forced to take vaccines.”In December 2021, UJ took the decision to make Covid-19 vaccination mandatory. The varsity said the policy, which came into effect on January 1, means that staff and students would need to provide their vaccination status before gaining access to any campus or facility.The measures also apply to ad hoc contractors, identified stakeholders and visitors.In a statement released on February 9, the institution reminded students that they must be at least partially vaccinated and upload their proof of vaccination on the website by February 14.UJ spokesperson Herman Esterhuizen is adamant that a student’s registration would be cancelled if she or he is not fully vaccinated and compliant with the university’s mandatory vaccination policy by March 31.“Students who do not plan to be vaccinated can under exceptional circumstances apply for an exemption.
