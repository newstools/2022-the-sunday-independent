CAPE TOWN - Murder accused and recently suspended police officer Richard Smit’s bail application has been postponed in the Piketberg Magistrate’s Court after his appearance on Thursday morning.National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the matter has been postponed to March 15 for further investigation.Defence attorney William Booth also wanted to further consult with his client, Smit, after Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) investigating officer Ronald Davids testified opposing bail.“Booth asked that all documents which the investigating officer submitted and used in his testimony must be copied and provided to him so that he can consult. Here documents include his previous convictions, a letter that confirms that he was suspended by the SAPS and copies of the petition and signatures that were handed by the community against his release on bail.“Smit submitted an affidavit in court but did not testify in his Schedule 6 bail application,” said Ntabazalila.Thursday’s court appearance comes after a previous court appearance of Smit where the defence was reprimanded for continuous delays which were “not in the interest of justice” as bail applications were to be dealt with expeditiously.Smit’s previous request to be moved to Saron prison had also been dismissed by Magistrate Pieter Grundlingh as Smit’s reasons – that he was “mixed with other prisoners at Malmesbury Prison” – were vague, but had endorsed a communication to the Malmesbury Prison authorities to investigate if any threat to the well-being of Smit at the prison arose.Smit faces seven charges which include the alleged murder of Natasha Booise on January 2, two counts of attempted murder of Roslin Kaaiman and Erin Plaatjies, discharging a firearm in a built-up area, handling of a firearm while under the influence of a substance which has an intoxicating or narcotic effect, and two counts of assault.Cape Times
