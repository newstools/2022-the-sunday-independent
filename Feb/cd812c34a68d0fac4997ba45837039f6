Tourists hold the golden key to unlocking the dreams of many to make travel adventures a reality.Kanandree Pather of GET Africa Travel, a tour operator dealing with African nature experiences, said a positive change for the sector beckons. Internationals travellers are geared up for travel.“On social media we see the disappointment people feel when they cannot travel due to flight restrictions and cancellations. So, this gives us a clear picture that there are people out there who definitely want to move forward with making travel memories.“Southern Africa is ready to welcome such guests from around the globe and we have excellent tourism people on the ground to make our guests feel safe.”MANCOSA, a leading distance education provider in Africa with regional and international accreditation, is hopeful that more students will register for their newly-launched tourism programme.MANCOSA is preparing students for the future, not today. Expectations are that tourism will be restored back to its former glory by the time they graduate. There will be a need for professionals to serve this industry.Sharon Classen, a former tourism student, said that studying tourism teaches one how to create added value, not only in the product proposition but also in a candidate’s employability.Classen was retrenched during the first wave of Covid-19 but her solid grounding and life skills, acquired during her studies, allowed her to bounce back. She is now employed as an assistant lodge manager for Rhino River Lodge in Manyoni, Zululand, which is known for Big Five safari tours.“No longer are employers looking for a one trick pony, more and more establishments are looking at employing versatile team members. As tourism begins to adapt to new ways of travel, industry tradesmen need to learn to adapt and develop skills to meet and exceed the expectations of travellers,” she said.Sunday Independent
