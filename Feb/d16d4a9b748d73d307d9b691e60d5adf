CAPE TOWN - The student representative council (SRC) at UCT has distanced itself from the attempted shutting down of dining halls on Friday night.The SRC said protests were led by non-UCT students who forcefully gained access to the campus and have, through a written student party statement, declared to make UCT “ungovernable”, should the university not fast-track the investigation into SRC president Mila Zibi who has been accused of rape.This follows posts on social media where a victim alleged that she was raped by Zibi on campus.UCT SRC acting president Siya Plaatjie said it was unfortunate that young students were misled into joining an attempted shutdown under false pretenses that it was to fight for accommodation and fee blocks.“The SRC notes, with contempt, the demonstration on campus through the shutting down of dining halls on Friday. This was not a directive from any member of the SRC. These demonstrations are headed by non-UCT students, who forcefully gained access to the campus.”Plaatjie said during the demonstration, men allegedly threatened and disrespected black and working-class individuals whom they claimed to fight for.“The SRC would like to further reiterate that we are not satisfied with the interim measure to lift fee blocks, only for students owing less than R10 000. At the same time, we note that the council is the only structure that can approve the lifting of all fee blocks, and thus remain in ongoing negotiations to make this goal a reality in the upcoming requested special council meeting,” said Plaatjie.UCT spokesperson Nombuso Shabalala on Sunday said there was no disruption to the dining halls service on Friday and there have been no further protest or disruptions through the weekend.“On Friday evening, a group of five students threatened to disrupt the University’s dining halls in support of a fellow student who had been suspended as a precautionary measure – while allegations of sexual misconduct made against him are investigated. After discussions with staff in the Department of Student Affairs, the students agreed not to go ahead with their protest.”On the Zibi investigation, UCT last week said they maintained a survivor-centred approach, while ensuring that a fair and due process is concluded as swiftly as possible.Cape Times
