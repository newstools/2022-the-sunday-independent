Voter turnout yesterday was 40.61%.The IEC said the Electoral Court had agreed to the postponement beyond the 90-day period of the uMdoni ward by-election that was scheduled for yesterday owing to challenges with the voters’ roll that was detected by a contesting political party.The by-election was going to take place after the former DA councillor won the ward from the ANC by 37 votes in the November 2021 elections and then resigned after he voted in support of the ANC mayoral candidate.The DA had raised concerns about 235 additional voters that had been added to the voters’ roll during the registration weekend in January 2022.The DA claimed that many, if not all of these voters did not live in the ward and had been bused in from neighbouring wards, including Umzumbe, and from as far as the Eastern Cape.A new date for the uMdoni by-election has yet to be announced.
