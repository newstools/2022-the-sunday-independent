CAPE TOWN - Talks of holding the ANC leadership accountable remain a pipe dream, says political analyst Professor Sipho Seepe, after ANC MPs voted against President Cyril Ramaphosa appearing before the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) to clarify his comments over misuse of public funds.Committee members, the majority of whom are ANC MPS, were asked whether Ramaphosa should be invited to appear before Scopa to make oral presentations and answer issues emanating from the leaked ANC NEC meeting recording and correspondence to questions sent to him in writing.Six ANC MPs voted to block the move while four opposition MPs were insisting on his appearance.Reacting to this, Seepe said on Thursday: “The ANC always protects its leaders. The only time a leader is left to the vultures is if they are no longer holding office.  Both president Zuma and president Mbeki were untouchable. The only time they suffered any humiliation is when they were no longer presidents of the ANC. Talks of holding the leadership accountable in the ANC is a pipe dream. Leaders dish out favours. It is these favours that make it difficult for followers to hold them to account.”Director at School of Public Leadership at Stellenbosch University, Professor Zwelinzima Ndevu, said: “This is an approach similar to what we saw during president Zuma's Nkandla saga, where the ANC MPs closed ranks around the president and we noticed that it fired back badly. One is hoping that this is not them (MPs) protecting Ramaphosa at the expense of accountability.”The party had suspended its MP Marvin Dirks who first asked Scopa to summon Ramaphosa after his remarks, where he was recorded saying that he was prepared to fall on his sword rather than revealing the names of people who had abused state funds.In his written answers to questions sent by the committee Ramaphosa denied knowledge of misuse of funds in ANC campaigns.The parliamentary legal services gave the committee legal opinion in the wake of Ramaphosa’s response to questions posed by the committee.Parliamentary legal adviser Fatima Ebrahim said the president confirmed the recording was for an ANC meeting held in March.Ebrahim said the essence of his response was that he did not have any direct or specific information of misuse of public funds for party political purposes other than that which was in the public domain arising from the Zondo Commission and other rumours.“The president’s statement does not deny that the public funds may have been used for party political purposes,” she said.Ebrahim said they had looked at the Zondo Commission report, which dealt with aspects of party political funding and testimonies during its hearings where witnesses made reference to State Security Agency’s funds used to influence decisions.“We also noted that there were other persons that testified and made references to matters of SSA (State Security Agency). These witnesses did not speak on party funding but financial mismanagement in the SSA.”“We are of the view that there is no reason why Scopa can’t have a closed meeting to consider these issues,” she said.Ebrahim said while Ramaphosa did not provide concrete evidence of alleged misuse of public funds for party political purposes, it appeared there was sufficient information in respect of SSA to warrant further consideration by Scopa.Cape Times
