He also claimed that Mphoki’s family, consisting of five dependants, would be adversely affected by his continued stay in jail as he was the main breadwinner.While the State did not oppose bail for Mphoki, State prosecutor Elton Marthinus implored the judge to set bail at R2000 due to the seriousness of the case and considering Mphoki’s position as a member of the SAPS.Marthinus also produced a letter written to the court by the Brackenfell Community Police Forum speaking against Mphoki being granted bail as motivation for the State’s request for bail to be granted at a higher amount.Speaking to the victim's decision to withdraw her case against Mphoki, the State said that it would leave the decision on the way forward up to the Department of Public Prosecution (DPP).Mphoki’s case was adjourned until March 30, 2022, when the State will announce the DPP’s decision.nomalanga.tshuma@inl.co.zaCape Argus
