Picture: SuppliedCamps Bay Ratepayers Association chairperson Chris Willemse said the sewer system in the area was outdated and should be replaced, but the City refuses to take responsibility. Willemse said a lot of energy has gone into worrying about pumping the water close to the shoreline as opposed to pumping it into the middle of the bay of Camps Bay, less than 700 metres from the popular Maidens Cove, which he said did not make a difference.“The City has made the big issue of closing off the beach to start pumping raw sewage into the ocean and the reality is when the system is weak it’s only putting the same sewage a few hundred metres further out. “The problems of a pump breaking down should not happen because, given the sensitivity of where the station is situated, there should be sufficient backups to ensure that something goes wrong it can be contained quickly,” he said.Resident Mark Jackson said there was a need to rethink the system and not merely apply a short-term bandage solution.mthuthuzeli.ntseku@inl.co.zaCape Argus
