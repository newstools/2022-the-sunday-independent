CAPE TOWN - The Department of Labour has remained mum over the action to be taken against Rheinmetall Denel Munition (RDM) after trade unions called for the suspension of explosive activity at the ammunition manufacturing site.This while a third sitting of the section 32 inquiry into the RDM 2018 explosion incident, which claimed the lives of eight employees, is yet to resume.During October last year, labour federation Cosatu and residents of Macassar and Somerset West picketed outside RDM where they demanded the suspension of explosive licences and activity at the site while the inquiry was still underway.Cosatu provincial secretary, Malvern de Bruyn, said no progress or feedback has been received since the memorandum of demands was handed over.“The progress on this is very slow at the moment and there is a need to engage with all parties again.

We will meet again to discuss these matters as there has been a considerable delay,” said De Bruyn.Department of Labour and RDM had not responded to enquiries by deadline.Macassar ward councillor Rhoda-Ann Bazier echoed the sentiments of De Bruyn.“We understood that a site visit was set to take place during February but we do not know where that process is now. “There has been no communication and it just seems like everything is in limbo while we get no feedback from the department of labour.“We demanded that all explosive activity is suspended at the site but weekly we still get reports of explosive materials being destroyed at the site and this is captured on CCTV footage of residents. There is never any communication or notices of such activity where they tell community they are destroying explosive off-cuts. We do not feel safe and still call for the suspension of those licences and explosive activity,” said Bazier.During the second sitting of the section 32 inquiry last year, the panel heard that the design of the building did not meet industry standards for explosive manufacturing, mixing and/or blending.It was also testified that “static electricity build-up” coupled with “human error when excess graphite was added to (material)” were suspected to be the cause of the deadly explosion.Cape Times
