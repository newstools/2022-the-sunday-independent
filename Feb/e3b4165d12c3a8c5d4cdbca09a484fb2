CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has signed a financing agreement of R84 million with German Development Bank, KfW, to fund the appointment of expert services for the implementation of its water strategy.The City said it was using the water strategy, approved on May 30, 2019, to redefine the relationship with water systems.The strategy includes five commitments: safe access to water and sanitation; wise water use; sufficient, reliable water from diverse sources; shared benefits from regional water resources, and becoming a water-sensitive city.“The provision of expert services will help the department with institutional restructuring, resource management, water demand management and sustainable wastewater management.“The grant can only be used for professional services and will allow the City to plan infrastructure projects that are future-proof and that reach international standards,” the City said on Thursday.Mayco member for water and sanitation Zahid Badroodien said the focus areas would also enable the City to achieve a vision to become the first on the continent to be a leading water provider to the world, provide safe access to quality water and sanitation services and ensure water resilience.Achievement of this would be measured by being admitted as a member of the Leading Utilities of the World – a network of the world's most successful and innovative water and wastewater utilities – within the next three years.“In order to achieve this vision and deliver on the five water strategy commitments, the City must assertively address a multitude of challenges, and leverage off current strengths.“Since July 2020, the City has conducted an internal consultative process to detail the scope of eight transversal programmes for KfW support. The programmes are designed to provide a set of practical, implementable and costed initiatives to embed the water strategy into the City, and fully achieve the water strategy commitments and achieve Leading Utility of the World status,” said Badroodien.Some of the key programmes that this funding will be used for are water demand management, sewer spills reduction and wastewater treatment.Cape Times
