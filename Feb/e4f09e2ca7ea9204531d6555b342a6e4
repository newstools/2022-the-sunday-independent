CAPE TOWN - They’re at work before the crack of dawn and long after most others have gone to bed.While waste pickers may be viewed as an irritation by some, they sure are making a difference to the environment.“We just want respect, we don't bother anyone but we are constantly harassed by security guards who chase us away from the bins or tell us not to sit on the benches that are open to the public,” said Nathan Mampies, a waste picker, or waste reclaimer, who operates from the CBD.It is estimated that South Africa has at least 215 000 waste pickers, and according to the Resources, Conservation and Recycling open journal, most of the approximately 46% of plastic that was collected for recycling in 2018 probably came from informal waste reclaimers.“It's more like a race instead of a competition. One wants to be faster than the other, and the other one wants to be earlier than the rest,” said 23-year-old Peter Leguma who scours the CBD along with his brother Junior Leguma.A waste picker scours for metals among the burnt rubble at the Msunduzi landfill that caught alight in Durban.

It is the same with us, the only difference is they are inside and we are outside,” she said.In 2018, Plastics SA reported that the majority of recyclable plastic collected was sourced from formal collectors.These formal collectors usually source their recyclable material from waste pickers.Vice-president of the Institute of Waste Management of Southern Africa (IWMSA), Mpendulo Ginindza, said whether waste pickers worked in a rural or urban environment, the fact remained that this was no easy job.“They are the first people on the road early in the morning. They sort through bins and carry the heavy waste on their trolley. Often, they don’t have the proper equipment and environmental conditions are not safe. Not to mention what they come across in the bins.”Ginindza said people could also assist by making life easier for waste pickers.“Start by separating your waste at home and at work. Avoid putting dangerous or hazardous items that they may come across when looking for recyclables in your bins. And of course, be more tolerant and patient on the road or on the street the next time you meet a waste picker at work.”
