DURBAN - Reports suggest that areas surrounding the University of KwaZulu-Natal's Howard College are no-go areas due to protest action.That was according to a message sent to a community group in Glenwood.Earlier on Wednesday, UKZN’s Howard College was a scene of chaos as students clashed with private security.The university’s private security fired rubber bullets at students, while streets leading up to the university’s main gate were blocked with rocks and burning material. An SRC member, who did not want to be named, for fear of victimisation, said the university was not responding to pleas and would not let students register their complaints directly to the administration teams.MORE ON THISUKZN students demand to be financially unburdened and allowed to register manually in protest outside the Westville admin buildingWATCH: UKZN’s Westville campus entrance blocked with burning tyres as students protest online registration policyUKZN condemns violent demonstration and destruction of property at Westville campusOne of the blockaded road at the UKZN’s Howard College. “Student representatives have a number of demands to the university, but most of all, we want the university to postpone the closure of registration. It has been over a month since online registration was started, yet, not even 50% of students have been registered.“There are first-year students who received firm offers last year, but still are not able to register. Add to that, the closure of 10 residences by the university. University management has not approved new residences, which could result in more than 1 000 students being homeless.”“Essentially, what led to the clash between the students and security was that they would not let us onto the school premises. Working from inside the campus, makes it easier for us to help students get access to the administrative stuff, but security denied us the right, then the shooting started,” said the SRC member.The university had not responded by the time of publication.Daily News
