Betty MoleyaCAPE TOWN - With adolescents being the most at-risk age group for suicide in the country, the SA Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) said it was focused on encouraging parents, teachers and the community to have difficult conversations around Teen Depression and Suicide Prevention.Teen Suicide Prevention Week started on Monday and will end on February 21.According to Sadag, the average suicide rate in teenagers is 8% of all deaths that have been reported by academic hospitals in the country, and, it said, the real figure can only be higher.It also said 20% of high school teenagers attempted suicide in the country.“Mental health education is crucial and factors contributing to teenagers ending their lives need to be looked at. We must all assist those who might be going through the same problem,” said the organisation.Factors identified as contributing to suicides among young people include depression.“In 75% of all suicides, the person gave some warning or made their intention known to a loved one,” Sadag added.In South Africa the most common method of suicide was hanging, Sadag said, followed by shooting, gassing, and burning, with 60% of people committing suicide being those who were depressed.Statistics have shown that suicide is the second most common cause of death in people aged 15 to 29, but some children as young as 6 have been deemed suicidal.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), every year 703 000 people take their own life, and there were many more people who attempted suicide.It said suicide occurred throughout the lifespan and was the fourth leading cause of death among 15-29 year olds globally in 2019.“Suicide does not just occur in high-income countries, but is a global phenomenon in all regions of the world. In fact, over 77% of global suicides occurred in low- and middle-income countries in 2019.“While the link between suicide and mental disorders (in particular, depression and alcohol use disorders) is well established in high-income countries, many suicides happen impulsively in moments of crisis with a breakdown in the ability to deal with life stresses, such as financial problems, a relationship break-up or chronic pain and illness.“In addition, experiencing conflict, disaster, violence, abuse, or loss and a sense of isolation are strongly associated with suicidal behaviour. “Suicide rates are also high among vulnerable groups who experience discrimination, such as refugees and migrants; indigenous peoples; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex (LGBTI) persons; and prisoners.“By far the strongest risk factor for suicide is a previous suicide attempt,” the WHO said. Sadag says its Suicide Helpline 0800 567 567 is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.Cape Times
