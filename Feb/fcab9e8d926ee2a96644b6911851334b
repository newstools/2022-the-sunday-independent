CAPE TOWN - Talking to teens about their mental health may not be easy, but starting the conversation is important.Marking Teenage Suicide Prevention Week from February 14 - 21, Stikland Hospital clinical psychologist Nicolize Nepgen has urged parents and guardians to talk to teenagers about their mental health.“According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression is globally the third highest disease burden among adolescents and suicide the second leading cause of death in 15- to 29-year-olds, while the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) states that 9% of teenage deaths in the country are due to suicide.”She says that understanding the signs of depression and talking about mental health are key preventing suicide.“Communities that have insight into this serious matter can assist with the prevention of suicide. Prevention of teen suicides starts with better understanding of the symptoms of depression. Most people with depression are not suicidal, but most suicidal people are depressed.”While parents may not always know what to look out for or what to be concerned about, Nepgen said warning signs included:Withdrawing from social contact.Talking or writing about suicide.Feeling trapped, hopeless or helpless about a situation.Changing normal routine, including eating or sleeping patterns.Doing risky or self-destructive things.Giving away belongings when there is no other logical explanation for why this is being done.Having mood swings.Increasing the use of alcohol or drugs.Developing personality changes or being severely anxious or agitated when experiencing some of the warning signs listed above.“Talking about mental health and suicide are important. Don’t wait for your teen to come to you. If your teen is sad, anxious, depressed or appears to be struggling – ask what’s wrong and offer your support.“If your teen is thinking about suicide, listen to what your child is saying. Never shrug off threats of suicide as a melodrama,” Nepgen said.She advised parents to monitor social media use.“If your teen is hurt or upset about social media posts, encourage him or her to talk to you or a trusted family member or friend.“Talk to your teen about treatment plans and monitor medication use. Don’t try to argue them out of suicide and avoid guilt-inducing statements like ‘suicide will hurt your family’. Rather let them know you care and want to understand they are not alone, and that problems and suicidal feelings are temporary – that depression can be treated, and problems can be solved.”Visit a primary healthcare facility or clinic for support, or contact:SADAG – toll-free number – 0800 567 567Lifeline Suicide Crisis Helpline – 0800 121 314 /0861 322 322Adcock Ingram Helpline – 0800 708 090Akeso Psychiatric Response – 0861 435 787Childline – 0800 055 555Cipla 24hr Helpline – 0800c456c789Dr Reddy’s Helpline – 0800 212 223Cape Times
