Duduzile posted a picture of herself and Zuma, and said the year 2022 was going to be a significant one as she would be turning 40 while her father would be turning 80.That prompted Holomisa to jokingly imply that Zuma was using some traditional concoction that was keeping him young and fresh, while at the same time drawing people to him and asking him to share it with him.kailene.pillay@inl.co.zaPolitical Bureau
