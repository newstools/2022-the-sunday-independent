CAPE TOWN - Hout Bay and Llandudno residents have been advised to fill up buckets of water to use on Wednesday, as supply disruptions are expected while the City of Cape Town fixes a pipe leak.The City’s water and sanitation department will be attending to the leak on the 300mm diameter water main in the vicinity of Riverside Terraces in Hout Bay.This will affect the water supply to the Suikerbossie Reservoir, which in turn supplies the Park Avenue, Mount Rhodes, Suikerbossie and Llandudno areas.This water supply main will be shut off on Wednesday at 9am until the repairs are completed.“Careful consideration has been given to the planning of this work to allow the residents in the affected areas to store water upfront in clean, sealed containers for domestic use, while the pipeline repairs are being done. The City will also fill up the Suikerbossie reservoir in advance for this purpose,”  Mayco member for water and sanitation Zahid Badroodien said.“Residents are requested to minimise their water consumption during this period to reduce the strain on the supply network.”A tanker will be made available to provide water for domestic consumption where required.Residents have also been advised that Covid-19 protocols will be applicable when collecting water from the tanker(s).Residents are advised to bring their own containers.“The City sincerely regrets any inconvenience caused and appreciates the patience of consumers.”Cape Times
