CAPE TOWN - Another death of an initiate in the Eastern Cape has been recorded, this time in the Chris Hani District Municipality, bringing the total number of deaths to 12 in the region this initiation season.Six deaths were reported at the Emalahleni Local Municipality, four in Enoch Mgijima Local Municipality, and two in Sakhisizwe local municipality.Last month, the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa (Contralesa) said at least 27 boys have died in the province so far.Chris Hani District Municipality Council speaker Jongumzi Cengani said the district municipality has strengthened support to the district Initiation Forum and they are hard at work working with all relevant structures.“The teams are busy across the district monitoring initiation schools, adherence to health protocols and ensuring intervention of government whenever necessary. We commend the efforts of these teams and urge them to continue saving lives until the last day of the initiation season. However, we are saddened by the loss of lives as most of these deaths could have been avoided. Dehydration and ill-health cannot be causes for deaths of initiates while resources are available at our disposal. Let us save lives and collectively closely monitor initiation schools to mitigate further eventualities. No initiate must be denied drinking water and medical attention,” said Cengani.He has urged for co-operation from all involved parents, traditional surgeons and caregivers to ensure their safe return home.The Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa Contralesa provincial chairperson Nkosi Nonkonyana said they were concerned about the number of deaths in Eastern Cape. “Initiation of boys to manhood is well entrenched in the hearts and minds of all Africans practising the custom. Like all our customs it cannot cause any injury let alone death.When this happened, we through the House of Traditional Leaders in the Eastern Cape established an ad hoc committee and its findings and recommendations were tabled at the sitting of the House and adopted. Among the key recommendations was that this custom  should be administered by traditional institutions where it belongs and all (traditional surgeons and guardians) should be accredited by them as we found that due to unemployment some inexperienced young men were using it as a form of providing them with money.“It is said that our government did not accept our recommendations and instead it took over the administration and deaths continued.”Nonkonyana said they had also tried to engage Western Cape authorities as they noted that initiates from Cape Town were travelling to the province in December.“We had also found that many initiatives in the province, particularly  in the coastal areas, died due to dehydration due to hot climate and (initiation huts) constructed by using plastics instead of grass. For this reason we recommended that initiation in such areas during summer be banned. We trust that our recommendation is being considered to amend the legislation accordingly.“We will again discuss this matter at a traditional leaders summit to be held soon.”Cape Times
