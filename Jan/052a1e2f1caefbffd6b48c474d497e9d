DURBAN - The Proudly South African campaign has called on South African consumers to make buying local their New Year’s resolution by shifting focus to locally made stationery and school-wear as back-to-school spending ramps up.Proudly South African campaign is a South African 'buy local' marketing campaign and logo, which was established in 2001, born out of the 1998 Presidential Job Summit, which was convened by the late former President Nelson Mandela.The campaign’s chief marketing officer Happy Khumalo-Ngidi said buying locally could make huge strides in turning the tide on unemployment levels in the country.She said job losses and pandemic-induced economic shocks had placed enormous financial strain on businesses and households over the past two years.MORE ON THISKwaZulu-Natal teacher unions worried about the readiness of looted and storm-damaged schoolsParents dig deep in pockets for uniforms, stationery as children head back to schoolTHIS is how much a basic school uniform will cost you in 2022Teacher unions call for probe into learning time losses due to rotational timetables“But the silver lining is that ongoing supply chain disruptions and rising shipping costs have forced top retailers to accelerate the move to local procurement to maintain their competitive advantage. This, in turn, has exposed buyers to a wide range of high quality, great value local alternatives available at bargain prices, helping families stretch their hard-earned rands a little further,” said Khumalo-Ngidi.Khumalo-Ngidi said with The Foschini Group sourcing 72% of its clothing apparel locally, and Mr Price’s merchandise sourcing up from 31% in 2015 means another competitive locally manufactured choice for value-focussed families.She said this was the time for shoppers to play their part by supporting South African products and directing money towards local businesses and local jobs in order to invest in a better future for the country.“This begins with something as simple as back-to-school shopping, which is the perfect time to set an example for our children by showing our national pride and responsibility to job creation and to sustaining jobs,” she said.Daily News
