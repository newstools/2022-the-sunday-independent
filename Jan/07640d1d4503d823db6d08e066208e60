The two locked horns on Radio 702 where their differences played out in the open.Mashaba accused Khoza of having voted with the ANC during eThekwini inaugural council, which saw the ANC’s Mxolisi Kaunda beating the DA’s Nicole Graham for mayor.Mashaba also said Khoza’s election to municipal public accounts committee (MPAC) as chairperson was not sanctioned by the party because she never consulted the national leadership.Khoza said that sometimes it was difficult for founders to let go and allow those they appointed into leadership positions to exercise their discretion, adding that this was one of the major risk factors of newly established political parties.As a member of ActionSA, she then asked Mashaba to forgive her for the “imagined betrayal”, but defended her support from the ANC, saying the ANC councillors were not wrong in voting for her to chair MPAC.The provincial chairperson position has since been given to Musa Khubeka, who will hold it on an interim basis.kailene.pillay@inl.co.zaPolitical Bureau
