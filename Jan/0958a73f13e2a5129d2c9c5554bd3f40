CAPE TOWN - More charges are likely to be added against the suspect accused of breaking into and setting Parliament alight.The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said so far Zandile Christmas Mafe, 49, has been charged with housebreaking with intent to steal and theft, two counts of arson, possession of an explosive device and destruction of an essential infrastructure.“More charges are likely to be added as the investigation continues,” NPA spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said.“The State requested the court to postpone the case for the next seven days for bail information such as the confirmation of his residential address, whether he has any assets, any pending cases, any pending warrants of arrest against him and any previous convictions.“The State also requested the postponement to determine the schedule under which the accused will be charged as it intends to charge him under Schedule 5, while the defence insists that he must be charged under Schedule 1.”Ntabazalila said the postponement would also provide the investigating officer, Colonel Theron, with an opportunity to visit the crime scene to determine the extent of the damage.“The crime scene was still active until late yesterday which made it inaccessible. The State will oppose his bail application which he intends to bring at his next appearance scheduled for January 11.”Cape Times
