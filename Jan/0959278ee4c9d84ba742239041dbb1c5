Author Devon Boughtshepiso.tshabalala@inl.co.zaMany people dread reading motivational books for various reasons, one of which is that its promise is to give a one-size-fits-all solution instead of a tailor-made response to individual needs.However, first-time writer and motivational speaker Devon Bough gives readers a different perspective on motivational writing in his new book titled Get OVA it.“I’ve written this book in a way that people who have never read a book before or struggle with self-help books will be empowered to read. The first few chapters are bite-size because we live in a society that just wants quick reads on social media platforms.“It would take you at least four minutes to read the first chapter. Then at the end of the chapter, there are questions that readers must ask themselves,” he said.Bough, who hails from Johannesburg’s northern suburb called Atholl,  said his chosen title “get over it” is a loosely used term that he wants to give a deeper meaning to.In this book, Bough documents his harrowing journey, which began going awry at the tender age of 15 when he accepted a dare to down a bottle of tequila.This became the start of his life of addiction to alcohol, followed by two suicide attempts, 18 warrants of arrest, being set up for cheque fraud, and living with three Russian sex workers.In the space of a few years, his life had spiralled into one where he lived in constant danger, which could have seen him killed.“I lived with them (prostitutes) for a year while I worked in the tv industry as a freelance editor and paid off the debts every month.  When I was arrested,  I was kept in a holding cell for one night.“I paid back all the money over a period of one year even though I had been conned, with no financial gain, and all charges were withdrawn. I was 19 at the time,” said Bough, who is now 38-year-old.As Bough muddled his way through adulthood, making poor choices, he had carved out a life of extremes – the kind no one should ever experience. A life that ultimately led him  to the realisation that no one was going to rescue him.If he wanted his life to change and get himself out of the hole he had dug himself into, he had to take ownership and rescue himself.So, he took to heart some wise words from spiritualist R. Narayana Murthy and started clawing his way out of the hole.He took the first unsteady steps to overcome the crippling self-hatred he had been immersed in for far too long and freed himself.Bough’s book consists of 47 chapters and was chosen as one of the Exclusive Books’ Refresh Campaign.“I restructured over to OVA (Ownership, Vision, and Action). To be the conduit of change gives me the greatest purpose, and this is what I wanted to achieve with this book because I believe that our greater purpose is to serve others,” explained Bough.“I am eternally grateful that I was able to emerge from the struggles of my past to build a successful business in the luxury property space. I would love people to experience a deep state of joy, happiness, and gratitude.“If you want to grow, evolve, and stretch, then this is a book for you. No matter how stuck you feel, no matter how good your life is, if you want to grow and to heal if you want to deal with your ‘stuff’ and be a happier, more joyous person who can use their purpose, then you are the person I encourage to read my book,” he said with optimism.Sunday Independent
