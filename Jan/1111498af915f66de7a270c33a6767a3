CAPE TOWN - Two suspects have been arrested for the alleged murder of a 24-year-old man and wounding a 29-year-old, in a suspected gang-related shooting in Belhar at the weekend.Police spokesperson André Traut said Western Cape extortion task team members were alerted by a police helicopter crew of the shooting incident in Batavia Road, where suspects fled the crime scene on Saturday night.“Within minutes, the team was deployed in the area and arrested two suspects aged 22 and 25, and seized three 9mm pistols and ammunition. “The murder and attempted murder incidents are suspected to be gang related as the victims and the suspects are linked to rival gangs in the area,” said Traut.The suspects are facing charges of murder, attempted murder and possession of unlicensed firearms.Meanwhile, a Belhar woman was arrested the same day in connection with the discovery of 2 000 mandrax found in a house.Police searched the residence in Horn Street on Saturday, where the drugs were found.“It is suspected that the drugs belong to a known gang member in the area,” said Traut.He said while the circumstances leading to the drug discovery are under investigation, the woman is expected to appear at the Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court on Monday facing a charge of dealing in drugs.Police said 534 suspects sought on various serious offences including murder, attempted murder and business robbery were arrested last week during Operation Vutha Hawe.Among the suspects arrested were Rowan Fortuin and Duran Williams who were on  the police’s top 10 most wanted suspects in the Western Cape.Fortuin was wanted for a murder perpetrated in Kraaifonten in September 2017 and Williams for a Lentegeur murder in February 2017.They are also expected to appear on Monday in the Blue Downs and Mitchells Plain magistrate’s courts, where bail would be opposed, said Traut.Cape Times
