CAPE TOWN - The Cape Winelands Municipality’s Fire Services spent their Sunday afternoon in the scorching sun, working to put out two major fires in the region.In Agter-Vinkrivier in the Robertson Valley, a fire which was started by lightning late on Saturday afternoon was burning out of control.The fire teams also identified areas where lines were burning actively in the mostly inaccessible areas of the Langeberg Mountains.“The fire line is very large and due to a combination of factors including inaccessibility, the effective deployment of resources and in the interest of the protection of lives, infrastructure and property, the fire teams will act pro-actively.“The progress of the fire is being monitored by teams on both the Montagu and the Robertson sides. These teams will focus their resources on preventing the fire from reaching property,” the Fire Services said.In the Pearl Valley in Paarl, a fire was mostly contained by Sunday afternoon.The dense vegetation, most of which was still smouldering had caused a lot of smoke.“At this stage firefighting activities are going well, however teams are concerned that the wind may pick up causing sparks to travel to the nearby thatched structures.”Cape Times
