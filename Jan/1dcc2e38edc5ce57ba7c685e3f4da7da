CAPE TOWN - Robot racing is back at Killarney, aiming to create a safe and legal alternative to illegal street racing.Hosted by the City of Cape Town in partnership with the Western Province Motor Club, the initiative aims to encourage motor racing in a controlled environment.The first robot racing event was held in December 2016 and since then many successful motorsport events have taken place at the track.The first of this year’s robot racing events took place on Wednesday, January 19."We have experienced too many incidents in the past when motorists resort to illegal street racing, often resulting in serious injuries or fatal accidents. Illegal street racing also endangers the lives of other road users,“ said Mayco safety and security member JP Smith. “The events at Killarney create a safe alternative for those who would like to test their vehicle’s performance and their driving skills. Safety protocols are a priority at these very competitive and popular racing events which attract a lot of spectators,” said Smith.The two popular race categories are the Street to Strip and Robot to Robot events.Participation costs R70 per vehicle subject to safety checks. In addition, the vehicle must be licensed and roadworthy.The entry fee for spectators is R70 per person."We would like to encourage motor racing enthusiasts to make use of this  opportunity to put their cars through their paces and gear up on a race track, instead of illegally taking to public roads. “Our traffic officers will work closely with the Western Province Motor Club and we will continue with daily patrols to bring those to book who participate in illegal street racing,” added Smith.For additional information on races, visit the Western Province Motor Club at http://wpmc.co.za/Cape Times
