Pretoria - A family from Eersterust have been left in total shock and frustration after being left to sift through dirty blood-stained linen and cleaning supplies at the Mamelodi Hospital in an attempt to find the belongings of their loved ones.According to the family Johannes Januarie, 59, was admitted to the Mamelodi Hospital's casualty ward on January 5 and they were informed a day later on January 6 of his death due to natural causes.Januarie's ex-wife Althea Jacobs and his sister Jacqueline Januarie then decided to visit the hospital the following day in order to collect his personal belongings, however, this was only the start of their troubles.The family spokesperson Virginia Keppler, said first the family were left for hours to search through the hospital's admission books for Januarie's name to determine where he was admitted and had died in the hospital, as the staff at the hospital allegedly gave them the runaround.Johannes Januarie, 59, who was admitted and passed away at the Mamelodi Hospital.

A male nurse also tried to intimidate Jacobs by laying his hands on her but she secured her phone in the pocket of her skirt."Keppler said upon realising the difficult task in front of them and fearing for their safety at having to go through bloodstained dirty linen and possible Covid-19 exposure they opted to leave.However, she said the women were stopped by a group of about five staff members and security, who locked the casualty gate and demanded they delete the pictures taken."Jacobs refused and took out her phone again and snapped a picture of the locked gate and warned the staff that it was unlawful to detain them, but they didn't care even though a man outside was waiting at the casualty gate to be treated.""When the staff saw that the two women were not going to give up their phones they unlocked the gate and set them free. The ladies said they still want Johannes' clothes because in his culture they have to perform a ritual for his spirit to be laid to rest.""What these women have been through is inhumane. They are appalled at the behaviour of the staff and said only one doctor tried his best to assist them while he still had to see to patients."The locked gate at the entrance to casualty.
