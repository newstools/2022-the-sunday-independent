DURBAN - THE South African Community Crime Watch (SACCW) is in desperate need of funding to revive its missing persons field unit.Chief operating officer Mike Venter said their national field services remain grounded. Permanent staff had not received any remuneration again for December 2021. The SACCW reached out for support at the start of December 2021 and they have raised a total of R4 380.This was a drop in the ocean, Venter said, for a unit that handled an average of 250 cases per annum, including compiling of missing persons/children registers, human trafficking and gender-based violence extractions and placements.Venter said the SACCW did not charge for any services because they focused on those in the lower to middle-income bracket.The South African Community Crime Watch (SACCW) is in desperate need of funding to revive its missing persons field unit.I Supplied“We rely on the support of concerned citizens in the support of others. The only grace in all this over so many years has been the rescue of so many, as well as extricating so many from difficult (situations) and the closure brought to so many, both local and international families.“It is why we do what we do, but we can only commit to a stage which we have now reached the end of.”The SACCW network liaises with emergency services on the ground for a proactive, non-profit crime-fighting organisation, covering all nine provinces.SACCW has been in existence for 10 years.
