DURBAN - The Students’ Representative Council (SRC) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) has urged the public to assist in raising R6 million to assist students in financial debts.The idea was born due to the increasing debts of students which led them to be blocked from the university system. Students find it difficult to be financially cleared to register each year.This led the SRC to establish the SRC bursary titled #FundaUKZNStudent campaign in 2021. A total of R5.3 million was raised and was used to help about 695 students.UKZN SRC treasurer General Nazo Nxumalo said the bursary aims to counter unfortunate circumstances as it also helps students with no funding on registration fees.“We know the majority of our students come from low income communities and cannot afford to pay all the university fees each year. This put a strain on the university to carry such debt leading to our students being financially excluded from the university,” said Nxumalo.MORE ON THISOutstanding debt for Stellenbosch University’s graduating class of 2021 stands at R16.3 millionDigital crowdfunding platform raises over R21 million paying out fees of over 300 studentsHigher Education Department says student protests fuelled by various factorsNxumalo said any kind of help would be appreciated adding that sharing posters about the campaign would help UKZN students get a little closer to their dreams.“We urge the community to help us by donating to our initiative. A little goes a long way. No matter how small a donation would be appreciated for us to create UKZN graduates. We are also asking the university club societies and organisations in the community that are outside the university to play a part in the programme as we aim to raise as much as we can. The success of this campaign lies on everyone playing their part,” said Nxumalo.Daily News
