CAPE TOWN- Just hours after the fire at Parliament seemed to have been tamed, a sudden flare-up in the late afternoon saw emergency services responding to the scene again after firefighting staff were withdrawn on Sunday morning.On Monday night officials said the wind was getting steadily stronger and had ignited the smouldering wood inside the roof void space, parts of which were not accessible for dousing or dampening.Firefighters aimed to contain the scene to the current fire area above the fourth and fifth floors.City Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson Jermaine Carelse said: “The fire at Parliament has flared up. The void beneath the roof sheeting of the National Assembly (was) on fire.”Six firefighting appliances, as well as the hydraulic platform from the Roeland Street fire station and 34 firefighters, responded to the flare-up.This as the 49-year-old suspect accused of arson, theft and housebreaking in the Parliament fire is expected to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Monday.During a media briefing on Monday, National Council of Provinces chairperson Amos Masondo said the complete gutting of the National Assembly Chambers was “one of the biggest losses the people of South Africa have suffered in this fire” and was a “devastating incident”, while mopping-up operations were in progress.Masondo confirmed the office additions and renovations for President Cyril Ramaphosa and Parliament’s Speakers made during 2008, the Parliament Library, as well as the 120m Keiskamma Tapestry had not been affected by the fire.Masondo said multi-agency and multi-pronged investigations were under way and would be in full swing once the whole building was declared safe and handed over to the investigation team.“We ended a briefing meeting with some role players on this devastating incident (relating to) the fire that gutted some parts of the Parliament precinct and its aftermath. We are indeed deeply saddened by this incident. We are pained by the damage to the Old Assembly Chamber and the National Assembly Chamber and all the critical offices,” said Masondo.Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Patricia de Lille said the extent of the damage to the building would only be detailed in a preliminary report expected on Friday. A fire forensics and expert team arrived yesterday morning but had limited access to the affected areas in the Parliament building as smouldering smoke and heat retention, reaching a high of about 100℃, was being experienced.Damage and assessments were done using drone technology in areas where it was too unsafe to access.With Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula confirming that there had been a breach in security, which had been confirmed by CCTV camera footage, De Lille said footage had been obtained from the CCTV cameras. However, questions were raised as to why the security cameras were not manned at the time of the incident and how much damage could have been prevented if there had been a quicker response to the incident.“DPWI (Department of Public Works and Infrastructure) brought in a team of engineers ... and a drone is being used to assess the destruction. The costs, repairs and time frames are yet to be determined and we will only have a preliminary report on Friday morning,” said De Lille.Mapisa-Nqakula said the Cape Town Convention Centre has offered its facilities for use by the national legislature.“The second offer was made by the mayor of Cape Town and the offer is that the renovations have been done at the City Hall. If we wanted to use the City Hall at any time for Sona (the State of the Nation Address), it is the kind of venue which can take up to 1 000 people.“He also offered their old chamber for us to use as Parliament,” she said.* Additional reporting by Mayibongwe MaqhinaCape Times
