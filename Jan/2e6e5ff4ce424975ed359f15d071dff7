Cape Town - Quality assurance examination board Umalusi has approved the release of the 2021 National Senior Certificate (NSC) exam results, with the council revealing it was investigating incidents of pupils having early access to exam papers before writing them.Umalusi council chairperson John Volmink said that having studied all the evidence presented, the executive committee of the Umalusi council noted that apart from some examination irregularities identified during the writing and marking of the exams, there were no systemic irregularities reported that compromised the credibility and integrity of the November 2021 NSC examinations as a whole.Matric results for public schools will officially be released on Friday, with Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga expected to announce the national results for the class of 2021 during a televised address on Thursday night.The five-week NSC examinations, which began on October 27 last year, were written by 897 786 registered candidates, comprising 735 677 fulltime candidates and 162 109 part-time candidates.As the Independent Examinations Board (IEB) results are expected to be published today, chief executive Anne Oberholzer said the 2021 NSC pass rate was 98.39%, slightly higher than last year’s pass rate of 98.06%.

The conditions of the court ruling must be taken into account in line with the provisions of the Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013,” said Mhlanga.SA Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) general secretary Mugwena Maluleke said it was their view that the ruling and those who brought the matter to court were about protecting the business interests of media houses above those of pupils and parents.Maluleke said the education system was still heavily laced with glaring inequalities.“The current cohort of matriculants also had to deal with two years of disrupted learning due to the pandemic,” said Maluleke.He said it was thus unreasonable in the extreme to expect them to also face the pressure of the negative social implications that come with the mass publication of results.“Publishing of matric results does not bring any educational benefit to those directly concerned, being our learners. The publishing of the results only brings extra monetary value to the media houses.”sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.zaCape Argus
