She said it was surprising that members of the portfolio committee had been up and down with the MEC doing monitoring and evaluation but when the results were released he did not see the need to invite them.“We await a full explanation from the department regarding their motivation for excluding the IFP from the event,” concluded her statement.Mshengu dismissed IFP’s complaints saying the legislature was represented by the speaker and the chairperson of the portfolio committee. He said no other political parties were invited.To comment on this story, send a WhatsApp message to our BackChat column on 071 485 7995Daily News
