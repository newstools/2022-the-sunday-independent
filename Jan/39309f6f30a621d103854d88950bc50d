In the name of modernism, liberalism and appeasing Western friends and protectors, the “House of Saud” in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, distorts and misrepresents important principles of Islam.The absolute monarchy-led regime’s religious, social, political and economic restructuring are not according to the teachings of the Quran and Prophet Muhammed’s traditions, his famous farewell sermon and lifestyle. Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) shaped Arabia, not the current Saudi Arabia, into a place like no other. The Quran and Islam, as a way of life, not only guarantee human rights, rule of law, accountability and fundamental human values, it also offers solutions for the transgression of these inalienable rights.Although Arabia is the place of the annual Hajj pilgrimage, home to the blessed cities of Medina and Makkah and the other religious and sanctified sites of Islam, the Saudi monarchy regime does not represent Muslims.The reality is that the Saudi monarchy system is not the expression of the Islamic way of life. The reform policies or vision 2030 of the aspiring de-facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, are not according to the Sharia law. His interpretations and understanding of the divine texts and Prophet Muhammed’s traditions are flawed and unacceptable. The prince’s adulteration of Islamic values are adding to the restlessness, disapproval and discontent of Muslims not only within the Kingdom, but also across the globe.Mohamed Saeed, Pietermaritzburg.Daily News
