CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has welcomed a Western Cape High Court ruling declaring the outdoor advertising signs and structures at the top of Long Street unlawful.The advertising structures and signs are on the facades of the Overbeek Building at the intersection of Long and Kloof Streets, and were installed some years ago.Their approvals in terms of the City’s previous advertising and signage by-laws lapsed and the advertising structures and signs have since continued to be displayedThe Western Cape High Court on Friday instructed the owner of the ‘Overbeek Signs’ to remove the ‘offending’ outdoor advertising structures and signs, at its cost, within 15 court days from service of the court’s order, failing which the Sheriff of the court is authorised to remove the structures and signs at the owner’s cost."This matter has been ongoing for several years since the City launched enforcement proceedings to have the illegal signage and structures removed from this prominent building in one of Cape Town’s most scenic and touristy suburbs."We welcome the judgment and implore the owner to comply with the ruling. It is also worth mentioning that the judgment confirms the constitutionality of the City’s Outdoor Advertising and Signage By-law," the City said.Deputy Mayor and mayco member for Spatial Planning and Environment, Eddie Andrews said the by-law regulated outdoor advertising."This is very important as each suburb has unique visual, historical and cultural value and appeal and we must protect and promote our city’s sense of place, heritage, scenic routes and tourist destinations."Outdoor signage can benefit our local economy, but it must be located at appropriate locations, and this is why the by-law guides the City when we assess applications. I encourage all to please comply with this by-law and to submit applications for outdoor signage to the City for approval prior to installation," Andrews said. Cape Times
