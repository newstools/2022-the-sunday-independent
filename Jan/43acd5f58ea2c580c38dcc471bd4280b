DURBAN - A discussion titled ‘Double-edged sword: How technology can combat wildlife crime’ will take place between role players in Pretoria on Thursday.The Institute for Security Studies (ISS) reported that technology enabled nimble and innovative responses in the fight against wildlife crime.The ISS said harnessing these opportunities is essential, as wildlife crime is driving the rapid and increasingly irreversible depletion of animal populations and also undermines human security and development.“Tech is not a silver bullet, but it can boost efforts to combat wildlife crime if used responsibly. Solutions must be developed, procured and implemented with sustainability and the local context in mind. This calls for a rethink around the skilling and resourcing of those responsible, especially the role of data analysts,” the ISS said.Among the role players are Kevin Pretorius, founder of the GreenLaw Foundation South Africa; Dr Bernard Rey, head of delegation for the European Union Delegation to South Africa;  Jacqueline Cochrane, a research consultant for Enact, ISS Pretoria; Ashwell Glasson, co-author and registrar at the Southern African Wildlife College; retired Major-General Johan Jooste, project manager of environmental law enforcement at the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environmental Affairs (DFFE); Carmen van Tichelen, chief analyst at the Environmental Enforcement Fusion Centre, DFFE; and Sharon Haussman, CEO of the Greater Kruger Environmental Protection Foundation, South Africa.MORE ON THISPoaching for the horticultural market is threatening cycads in SA says the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised CrimeAlmost 900kgs of South African rhino horns destined for Asian countries seized between 2014 and 2021Suspected poacher shot in Isimangaliso Wetland Park was small-scale fishermanSuspected poacher shoots police officer in the jaw during search for missing houseboat crewman at Jozini DamThe Green Law foundation, as conservationists, lawyers, educators and strategists, empowers and creates an understanding of conservation among people and organisations and empowers them to conserve.They uniquely combine conservation, education and law to enable all who are involved in conservation, conservation enforcement and protection.Daily News
