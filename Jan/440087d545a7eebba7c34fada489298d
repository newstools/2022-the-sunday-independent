CAPE TOWN - The damage caused by torrential rains in the Buffalo City metro in the Eastern Cape was still being assessed, as residents and officials on Monday banded together to start mop-up operations.Heavy rains at the weekend caused flooding to many homes in informal settlements and in the rural areas.At least seven people were reported to have died, including SAPS driver Captain Pierre Marx, 53, who went missing on Saturday during a rescue operation.His body was recovered the next day.Eastern Cape Premier Lubabalo Oscar Mabuyane and Buffalo City Executive Mayor Xola Pakat, along with municipal officials, the Disaster Management Unit and ward councillors were out yesterday assessing the damage.“It has been devastating to many households in our metro, more particularly those residing in low-lying areas and informal settlements.“It is sad to confirm that we are aware of human lives that have been lost so far due to drowning.“We want to send our deepest and more sincere condolences to their families and loved ones.“We are on high alert but we ask everyone to be vigilant and report all incidents to our Disaster Management Unit on 043 705 9000.”The heavy rains completely submerged parts of Mdantsane, making access to distressed communities more difficult.The municipality also confirmed that zones 1, 3, 9 and 18 as well as the Joe Slovo informal settlement were among the hardest hit areas.“The metro is working with the Eastern Cape Department of Human Settlements to render much needed assistance to those that have been displaced, motorists have been urged to avoid crossing flooded roads and bridges.“The metro has also activated its disaster management teams including fire services, traffic services and law enforcement,” they said.Cape Times
