DURBAN – A resident, landlord, community policing forum and police were very instrumental in the closure of a brothel in the Umbilo area on Friday.In a Facebook post, Umbilo community policing forum (CPF) chairperson Heather Roos said for months a concerned resident, the landlord of a property and Roos had been communicating, gathering information, keeping observation and keeping each other updated until they had more than enough evidence, which they took to the police.“The police then had more than enough evidence to work with … and with the full committed co-operation and assistance of the landlord and him coming on site yesterday (on Friday) as well, this brothel was finally closed,” Roos said.“What was found in this house was a shock and disgusting, and proves that we never fully know what goes on behind closed doors and high walls.”Roos said thanks to a resident who refused to just sit back and worked with her, together they got hold of the landlord and notified him about what was going on.MORE ON THISFestive season is also when all types of crimes escalate in Durban, warns CPFCPF slams pet owners who fail to keep their animals safe during inclement weatherCar remote jamming a concern in UmbiloResidents urged to report crime to policeDurban homeowner robbed three times in 35 hours during coronavirus lockdownShe said he (landlord) was horrified as he had gone through a managing agent for this tenant, who subsequently had then sublet to this brothel, knowing full well it was a brothel.She also said the names of the resident, landlord and address of property were being withheld and will not be disclosed as it was an ongoing investigation and they have to respect their privacy and safety.“We have not given up on the all other brothels across areas in this community that were reported to us, we (are) hoping that these landlords have a change of heart and work with CPF to achieve the same, and that residents too trust us enough to want to get this done and work with us rather than against us, on each affected property. It's not easy, it's not a quick fix, yes it's possibly taking years, but with everyone pulling together and mainly with the help from the landlords of these properties, it can get done through this system we used, here is the proof,” Roos said.Roos thanked all role-players for Friday’s success in closing the doors of the brothel and giving the landlord back his property but not in a good condition.“Thank you to Umbilo station commander Colonel Teddy Munusamy, to Captain Govender for coming on board late with us but pushing to help us, to the team who went in yesterday (Friday) to make sure these unwanted pimps, prostitutes, etc, all were removed from this house without incident and charges made,” Roos said.“A big thank you to the resident, to the landlord who did not just sit back and shrug his shoulders and just collect rent, but who genuinely fought with whatever he could with us to close this brothel down.”Roos said she was asked by those that worked closely with her to make the post and thanked her for pushing this continuously.“For putting my life on the line and listening and doing what I could to get this done. They asked me to put this up for the many doubters that doubt that the current CPF are actually not working or doing anything good for this community and especially myself as CPF chairperson who is always getting fingers pointed at. So thank you to them for recognising and asking me to post this,” Roos said.She said their battles as CPF were tough. It was a lot of work which was voluntary, no remuneration and they had to use their own resources and pay their own costs. There was a lot of personal danger but did not stop fighting and working for their community.“You may not hear or see what all we have done or doing, as we don’t broadcast it all over as we are not allowed to without consent from SAPS, but those around that have seen or been helped first hand all know,” Roos said.Police had not commented by the time of publication.Daily News
