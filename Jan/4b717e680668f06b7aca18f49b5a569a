CAPE TOWN - The Chris Hani District Municipality (CHDM) has declared a state of disaster after severe weather conditions caused widespread damage to property, infrastructure and community assets.The CHDM Council took the decision during a special meeting on Friday after receiving a disaster incident report about the storms that hit the district between December 13 and January 8.The declaration was made in terms of the Disaster Management Act 56 of 2002, for mobilising much-needed resources and to ensure adequate support is provided to affected communities.The disaster incident report presented to council reflected areas affected by the severe weather, which saw heavy downpours.“Severe hailstorms and strong winds caused severe damage to property, environment, basic service infrastructure and community assets,” the CHDM said in a statement.Several municipalities were affected, including Emalahleni, Engcobo, Intsika Yethu, Enoch Mgijima and Inxuba Yethemba municipalities, and 135 properties were damaged with more than 50 families left homeless.“Assessments were conducted in collaboration with all relevant departments and organs of state. Structural damages ranged from partially to totally destroyed houses, and it is such a huge relief that no fatalities were reported,” the CHDM said.On completion of the assessment, damage assessment reports were forwarded to the Provincial Disaster Management Centre and to the Department of Human Settlement in Bhisho – Emergency Housing section, a unit that deals with disaster-stricken areas.“We are expecting swift turnaround times in processing the application submitted and with provision of temporary structures to the families. The departments of Roads and Transport are also busy conducting assessment of all road infrastructure  affected in our area.”A State of Disaster was previously declared in October 2014 following a tornado that hit four municipalities in the district, and in January 2011, 2015 and October 2019, following prolonged drought that strained water sources.Cape Times
