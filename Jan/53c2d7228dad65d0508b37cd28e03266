The City acted by building a supporting wall and backfilling with compacted sand.“In 2021, we received another notification of illegal sand mining at the bridge.“Again, we backfilled all areas and included a concrete layer on the top to prevent further sand mining. Extra milling material was placed against the embankments to prevent the illegal miners from gaining easy access to the sand we used for backfilling.“This has to stop.“Illegal sand mining has already cost lives.”The incidents can be reported to SAPS and the Transport Information Centre on 0800 65 64 63.Cape Times
