May you cherish the time together with your little ones, as parenthood is one of the best journeys.”She said a child’s health is most vulnerable during the first 1000 days of its life as this period, from conception until a child’s second birthday, offers a unique window of opportunity to shape healthier and more prosperous futures.Mbombo emphasised the importance of the first 1000 days of a baby’s life.“We are excited to be part of this journey, from your baby’s first immunisation to their first steps; we are here to support you. I encourage all parents to remember the importance of the first 1000 days of a child’s life. It is important to create a nurturing and healthy environment for your baby along with good nutrition, which can impact on a child’s ability to develop and learn.“Ensure that your baby is fully immunised and follow the advice of health workers at your local clinic. Make time to play with your child and support him or her as they grow and develop. Remember to take care of yourself as well,” she said.Find out more about the first 1000 days of a child’s life at: www.westerncape.gov.za/first-1000-daysCape Times
