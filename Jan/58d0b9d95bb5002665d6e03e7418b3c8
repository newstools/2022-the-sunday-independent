CAPE TOWN - The family of little Enkosi Nkolisa who went missing in Crossroads and was later found knocked by a car along the R300 highway, has laid their child to rest.However it remains a mystery who the man was who allegedly claimed to be the two year old’s father and disappeared with him. Enkosi went missing on December 16 at about 5pm wearing a yellow top and blue denim pants. He was last seen by a neighbour in the Lloyd Informal Settlement.The following day a toddlers body was found dead on the road but Enkosi’s family were not aware of the incident and continued a frantic search for him throughout the weekend.They identified the body on December 22 and the toddler was buried on Thursday. When the Cape Times visited the family, the boy’s 30-year-old mother, Nomakholwa Nkolisa, said she left Enkosi playing with her neighbours’ children while she went to buy something to eat from a local shop.According to Nkolisa, when she returned the neighbours informed her that the boys ’father took him’.“Later at night I called his father who stays in Marikana, Philippi asking him when he intended to bring the child back. But he had no idea what I was talking about. Then I approached residents to assist me to look for him to no avail,” she said.Someone who saw a Pink Ladies missing persons flyer on social media informed police about a child who fitted Enkosi’s description, who was knocked by a vehicle. The mother said she would only find closure when she gets answers about who the man was who allegedly abducted Enkosi and how her child ended up on the road. Police spokesperson Joseph Swartbooi said a case of culpable homicide and circumstances leading to the incident were still being probed by Mfuleni officers with no arrests yet.Councillor Nceda Ntshweza said: “The child was buried on Thursday. The funeral service was held there in his home. We are also still urging residents who may remember anything of that day that could (give) assistance to the police with the case to do so.”Anyone with information on the incident can anonymously contact Crime Stop on 0860010111, or SMS Crime Line on 32211.Cape Times
