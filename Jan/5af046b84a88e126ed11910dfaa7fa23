CAPE TOWN - A magistrate’s attempt to appeal against his sentence and conviction for fraud has been dismissed by the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA).Azwifaneli Mphanama - who is also a senior magistrate and the judicial head of the Magistrate’s Court of Dzanani in Limpopo - was found guilty on five charges relating to fraud and corruption after ultimately defrauding the Department of Justice.Mphanama had made false claims in terms of a motor vehicle benefit scheme for travelling costs and was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, which was suspended for three years.According to court documents, Mphanama had declined to testify in the case after the State found he had a prima facie case to answer to and in the absence of his testimony under oath, he had failed to prove his innocence.“When undertaking official trips during the period (from May 2008 to March 2009) Mphanama utilised a Toyota RAV4 1800cc petrol multi-purpose vehicle, a RAV4; and/or was entitled to be compensated by the Department in terms of General minute 19 of 2008 for official trips undertaken during the period in terms of the prescribed tariffs for the RAV4; and/or claims submitted by the appellant for the kilometres driven were supposed to be calculated in terms of the prescribed tariffs for the RAV4.“And when making the representations, Mphanama knew that the vehicle which he used to undertake the official trips during the period was a Cadillac 200cc petrol sedan and not the RAV4 and he was not entitled to submit claims on the tariff applicable to the RAV4, as he did not utilise that vehicle for undertaking official trips. As a result of the aforesaid misrepresentations, which the Department accepted, it processed the claims and paid Mphanama in terms of the tariff applicable to the RAV4, instead of processing the claims in terms of the tariffs prescribed for the Cadillac. This was to the prejudice of the Department in that the difference between the amount claimed and received, and the amount which should have been claimed and paid out was R10 353.09,” court documents read.According to Mphanama’s version, after he had sold his vehicle to a certain Ms Phiri, an arrangement was made that he would still use the RAV4 for official duties. The court concluded that Mphanama’s version was improbable.During trial, Magistrate Nditsheni Makamela testified that “prior to April 2008, Mphanama had driven a RAV4 for all his official duties. However, in approximately late April or early May 2008, the appellant informed him that he had bought the Cadillac vehicle. From late April 2008, Mphanama only drove the Cadillac. Mphanama informed Mr Makamela that he had sold the RAV4 to (a) Ms Phiri,” court documents further read.Another witness, Bernard Stapelberg a magistrate with the Judicial Quality Assurance Office, was appointed to investigate various complaints lodged against Mphanama and testified there would be nothing irregular in interchanging motor vehicles, as long as the kilometres claimed and the tariff used belonged to the vehicle being used.Acting Judge, Sharice Weiner, said: “In failing to testify, the appellant did not answer the prima facie case against him, and he ran the risk of that proof becoming conclusive proof, as there was nothing to gainsay the version of the State. The evidence produced by the State proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that fraud was committed and that the appellant was correctly convicted.”Cape Times
