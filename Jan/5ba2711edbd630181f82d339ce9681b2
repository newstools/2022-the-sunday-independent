CAPE TOWN - A healthy baby girl made her unexpected arrival at Camps Bay beach on Sunday with the assistance of City staff and volunteers.The City said at about 11.15am, an Identikidz staff member asked for assistance with a young woman in labour.City Disaster Risk Management Centre (DRM) volunteers Marylin Afrika, Rahdee Salie, Judith Henn and Aaliyah Anthony assessed the situation and found the baby was already crowning.The team then assisted the mother with the delivery of the baby and ensured both could wait undisturbed until paramedics arrived.“Our teams are on duty every day over the holiday season for any emergency and to assist beach goers,” safety and security mayco member JP Smith said.“This new year surprise has provided a little extra festive cheer. We commend our volunteers for staying cool under pressure and helping the mom give birth. Our staff have quite the track record in helping bring new life into the world.He said it was just over five years ago that two other Disaster Management staff members also helped deliver a baby in the Camps Bay area just before Christmas.“On that occasion, it was a boy who was named after one of the staff members. Well done to all,” Smith said.Cape Times
