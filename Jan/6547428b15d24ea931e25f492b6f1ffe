CAPE TOWN- POLICE have yet to make an arrest following an alleged arson incident at the Department of Justice’s regional office in the CBD on Friday.The fire, which came days after the arson incident at Parliament, a national keypoint, caused minimal damage to a door at the building, in Queen Victoria Street.Police spokesperson Wesley Twigg said an arson case docket was opened for investigation and no arrests had been made yet.This, while Parliament arsonist accused, Zandile Christmas Mafe, was expected to make his second court appearance in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, where he is expected to continue his bid to be released on bail.Mafe’s attorney has argued that his client has not been issued with a charge sheet yet and averred that this has prejudiced his client.In a document addressed to State prosecutor Adnaan Gelderbloem, Mafe’s attorney, Luvuyo Godla, said: “It is our submission that Mr Mafe’s Constitutional right to be informed of the reasons for (his) further detention has been grossly violated...it is not desirable to further detain Mr Mafe if you have not formulated your mind on the charges you need to press against him.”According to Godla, he had also requested the charge sheet from National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila after Mafe’s court appearance last week, but had not received it.Ntabazalila said the charge sheet could be found at the court, as it was a public document.“Godla’s behaviour is strange. He approached me on the steps of the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court immediately after I addressed the media and asked me for a copy of the charge sheet.“One expects him to know that the spokesperson of the National Prosecuting Authority is not the custodian of the docket.“It is strange that he runs to the media and make threats when he was told by the prosecutor that he can get the charge sheet in court as it is a public document,” said Ntabazalila.It has also been reported that Mafe’s legal counsel would include that of senior counsel advocate Dali Mpofu.Cape Times
