DURBAN - FORMER eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede’s name appears on lists circulating among ANC members suggesting her for the party’s provincial treasurer post.This comes ahead of the party’s provincial conference which is expected to be held later this year.Gumede’s supporters said they were aware of the lists, but they were focused on the ANC’s eThekwini regional conference where they aimed to have Gumede elected as regional chairperson.The regional conference is set for the end of the month and current eThekwini Speaker Thabani Nyawose is also expected to contest the top position.Gumede is seen to be part of the Radical Economic Transformation faction, aligned with former president Jacob Zuma, and Nyawose is linked with the Renew, Rebuild, Unite faction aligned to party president Cyril Ramaphosa.MORE ON THISZandile Gumede back at work as DA threatens to go to courtANC deliberates Gumede's futureMayor Zandile Gumede delivers eThekwini budget despite opposition howlsOn a list seen by The Mercury, one slate for the province has current ANC chairperson Sihle Zikalala retaining his position, with Sboniso Duma as his deputy, and Mdumiseni Ntuli retaining the position of provincial secretary with current education MEC Kwazi Mshengu as his deputy and Gumede as provincial treasurer.Another slate features former Newcastle mayor Ntuthuko Mahlaba as chairperson, Mdu Mhlongo as deputy chairperson, Sipho Hlomuka as provincial secretary, Ntokozo Nxumalo as deputy secretary and Gumede as treasurer.The emergence of the slates ahead of the provincial conference shows that lobbying for positions is in full swing.One of Gumede’s backers, Ntando Khuzwayo, confirmed seeing one of the lists, but said this would not distract them from their mission of having Gumede elected as regional chairperson.“There are a number of these lists circulating, although their origins are not known. We will not allow ourselves to be derailed and start talking of things provincial. Our focus is on the regional conference,” said Khuzwayo.He added that a lot of work had been done as part of campaigning and they were positive about Gumede’s prospects.Another Gumede backer, Njabulo Mchunu, said her appearance in different slates underlined her importance in provincial politics and showed that she had massive support.“The fact is that the work she has done as an ANC member and leader over the years has generated interest around her and there is a growing realisation that she is not just a regional figure.”He added that the eThekwini region was an important bloc for anyone with ambitions for provincial leadership and this was one of the reasons Gumede’s name appeared on the lists.“Everyone is always watching what the region is doing because the region is an important power base, and therefore it should come as no surprise that our comrade is being looked at for a potential provincial position,” said Mchunu.He maintained that if Gumede was to be considered for provincial treasurer, that would happen after she had been elected eThekwini regional chairperson and talk of provincial positions amounted to putting the cart before the horse.Several branches of the ANC in eThekwini are still set to hold their meetings before the regional conference takes place. With 112 branches, eThekwini is the ANC’s biggest region in KwaZulu-Natal.ANC KZN spokesperson Nhlakanipho Ntombela was not immediately available for comment yesterday.THE MERCURY
