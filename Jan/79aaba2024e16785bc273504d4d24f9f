Myers said a SAPS member and MC911 operations director Wynand Laatz noticed a suspect, gave chase and managed to arrest him.“Wynand then carried on searching for the other suspects and came across a parked car. He looked under the car, where he discovered another of the suspects who had bolt cutters strapped to his back. Wynand managed to detain the suspect and handed him over to SAPS.”A third suspect managed to escape.Myers said a police investigation will follow and they are hoping this will lead to the arrest of the outstanding suspect“We are also hoping that these suspects are linked to a spate of home invasions in the Westville and Cowies Hill area, which have terrorised residents for months and kept the neighbourhood watch members very busy.”Myers sent out a huge thank you to South African Police Service, the security companies and volunteers that responded, which resulted in two speedy arrests.Daily News
