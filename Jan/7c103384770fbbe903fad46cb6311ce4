Cape Town - The South African National Blood Service (SANBS) is currently experiencing a shortage of blood supply as blood stocks over the last year have decreased due to Covid-19.SANBS is running below the five-day supply recommended by the World Health Organisation and would need 3 500 units of blood donated daily in order to keep up with 810 000 transfusions given annually.SANBS has reported that less than one percent of the South African population donates blood regularly with a shelf life of only 42 days. SANBS medical director Dr Karin van den Berg said the shortage was a result of the blood drives not being as active as before.“Our traditional hunting grounds for donors, where traditionally we went to find our donors, have completely changed. About 60% of our blood was collected through our mobile blood drives. “Covid-19 has resulted in people working from home and so nobody is at work to get them to donate and the same thing has happened at schools and universities,” Van den Berg said.

Solidarity Fund adviser Dr Saul Johnson has said it is not possible for the vaccine to be passed on.“It is not possible to pass on the vaccine to someone who has received your blood donation because once the vaccine has stimulated the immune response, it breaks down and does not remain in your body. This generally happens about two or three days after receiving the vaccine. You can therefore donate and receive blood safely,” Johnson said.Van den Berg has urged donors to go directly to the SANBS to donate, and encouraged employers to contact the local blood service and invite them to their offices.rafieka.williams@inl.co.zaCape Argus
