We are just thankful to them all for supporting our industry.”Cape Town Tourism chief executive Enver Duminy said they were delighted to see recovery in the visitor economy, with domestic and international tourists injecting some sorely needed capital into the city. “We do understand that recovery will take a little longer than we had hoped but we are optimistic that this trend towards recovery continues in February, as we enter our ’second’ peak season. While the numbers look better, we need sustained tourism to really impact our local small business sector and start turning the devastating blows dealt by Omicron-linked travel bans around.”
