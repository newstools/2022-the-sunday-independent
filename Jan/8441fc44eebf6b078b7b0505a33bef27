CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Transport MEC Daylin Mitchell has written to Minister Fikile Mbalula, to request a further extension to the validity period of learners’ licences, diving licence cards, temporary driving licences and professional driving permits.Mbalula had issued a grace period until March 31 2022 for all documents which expired between March 26 2020 and August 31 2021.Mitchell said he believed that a further extension beyond March was required.“Given the widespread media reports on the current backlog in the production of driving licence cards, I suggested to Minister Mbalula that an extension should be applicable until at least December 31, 2022.“I also asked Minister Mbalula to confirm the veracity of some media reports stating the said backlog to be in the region of 400 000 and the time needed to rectify the situation,” Mitchell said.The only machine in South Africa able to print driving licence cards broke in November, causing a backlog of licence renewal applications.Mbalula announced on Wednesday that the machine had been fixed and was operational.“I took cognisance of the letters issued by the Acting Head of the Driving Licence Card Account Entity, Mr Sandiso Thutshini, issued on November 25 2021 and December 9, 2021 respectively,” Mitchell continues.“However, these letters did not provide any specific information around the backlog such as an age analysis and the extent of the backlog as the letters did not provide any definition plan of action to normalise the situation.“The news that the card machine has been repaired and is operating again is positive, but in order to enable my department to communicate accurate information to its stakeholders, I asked Minister Mbalula to supply the missing information and all the details that will assist this cause as a matter of urgency.”Cape Times
