Cape Town - Hundreds of people congregated in Long Street on Saturday for an open street, open-air dining experience held by the City in partnership with at least 13 restaurants.The attempt to revitalise the city’s CBD, its economy and to support local businesses was welcomed by residents and international visitors who flocked to the well-known nightlife street to wine and dine under the stars.Speaking to the Cape Argus, Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said the initiative was a measure to encourage economic recovery and greater footfall in the CBD. He said it started last month in Bree Street.“We all know the impact that Covid-19 has had on the CBD space. More innovative ideas were needed to enhance the attractiveness of our local businesses, especially those that fall within the hospitality industry. “So we partnered up with a good number of restaurants in the precinct to offer a unique dining experience of gourmet meals and local wines.MORE ON THISCity of Cape Town plans to close certain CBD streets over summer to make diners feel safe, says mayorTourism key in reviving Cape Town’s struggling economyPocket-friendly domestic travel thriving in the Mother City this festive season“I must say the response we received from this event was overwhelming and exhilarating.
