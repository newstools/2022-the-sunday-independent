CAPE TOWN - The City is looking to regulate the management of its sporting facilities, giving residents one more week to have their say on the draft sports asset management policy.In the early 2000s, the then sport and recreation department introduced the “sport and recreation institutional framework” which set out a facility management strategy based on the establishment of sports facility management committees.Municipal facility management committees (MFMC) were introduced as a mechanism to informally standardise both the engagement between the City and sport clubs, as well as to create a governance framework that would address how sport assets could be managed.However, the City said the policy had not been without its challenges.“This system has been more successful in some instances than others, depending on how well organised the management committees are. There are also no clearly defined and documented roles and responsibilities, which has unfortunately resulted in incidents of mismanagement, lack of accountability and asset maintenance, among others.“It’s imperative that the City is able to meet the needs of the growing sporting fraternity, and this draft policy aims to put all of the right mechanisms and systems in place to ensure that we can manage our sporting facilities optimally, for the benefit of the sporting fraternity and communities in general. “I urge interested and affected parties who have not done so yet to engage with the draft and submit their comments before the deadline,” said the City’s mayoral committee member for Community Services and Health, Patricia van der Ross.The public participation process started on November 1 until December 15 and resumed on January 15 until January 31.Comments, input or recommendations on the draft policy can be submitted by emailing Biance.Johnson@capetown.gov.za, hand-delivering at the nearest sub-council office or online at www.capetown.gov.za/haveyoursayThe draft policy is available here: https://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/Bylaws%20and%20policies/Draft_Sport_Assets_Management_Policy.pdfCape Times
