Picture: Nhlanhla PhillipsThe Gauteng Department of Health’s retired deputy director for mental health is expected to testify at the Life Esidimeni inquest on Monday, January 17 in Pretoria on her disastrous role in bypassing legal processes when issuing licences to NGOs earmarked to take care of psychiatric patients.Hannah Jacobus is one of the 36 key witnesses is expected to testify virtually in front of Judge Mmonoa Teffo in the North Gauteng High Court. The judge is expected to compile a report confirming the identity of each of the 144 patients who died following the rushed transfer, determine the date of each of their deaths, and make findings on the legal cause of death for each of them.During her testimony four years ago at an alternative dispute resolution process, Jacobus said she had been forced by her senior, Dr Makgabo Manamela, to bypass legal processes when issuing licences to the ill-equipped NGOs.She further defended her role by telling the proceedings, led by retired judge Justice Dikgang Moseneke, that she had done all she could to do things by the book and speak up against wrongdoing during the marathon project.A Life Esidimeni family committee representative said of Jacobus’s expected testimony: “We expect her to tell the truth for her own inner peace and closure for the families, who are still suffering because of the death and suffering of our loved ones.”The DA’s shadow MEC for health, Dennis Bloom, said he was disappointed Jacobus retired before being held accountable for her role in the tragedy and asked why she had not blown the whistle if she had witnessed any wrongdoing on the part of senior officials.“I hope that Hannah Jacobus gives more details about the role of then Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu in pushing this terrible scheme against all professional advice. “We also need to know why she and other officials went along with it instead of publicly blowing the whistle on what was happening,” said Bloom.So far, six witnesses have testified at the inquest and all of them have blamed disgraced former MEC Qedani Mahlangu for the disastrous project.Sunday Independent
