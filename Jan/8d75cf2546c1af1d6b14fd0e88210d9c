CAPE TOWN - Humanitarian organisation Gift of the Givers has contributed R5 million to Groote Schuur Hospital to help with catch-up surgeries.The contribution is among many major interventions they’ve undertaken in the health sector, including supporting 210 hospitals nationwide during Covid-19, providing PPEs, scrubs, pulse oximeters, non-contact thermometers, video laryngoscopes, high-flow nasal oxygen machines, CPAP machines, medicines, food for patients, motivational goody bags for health-care workers, paying for additional support staff, drilling boreholes and carrying out infrastructure upgrades.“Among the many devastating impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic has been the massive loss of operating time and capacity at most hospitals across the country as health-care workers tended to patients severely ill with Covid-19. As a result, there are over 6 000 patients awaiting essential surgery at Groote Schuur Hospital.“Groote Schuur Hospital, under the management of the new surgical head, Dr Lydia Cairncross, will supervise the ‘catch-up’ of 1 500 backlogged surgical procedures of various medical conditions delayed by Covid-19.“Gift of the Givers has made R5 million available for this initiative. Full details to be outlined at a press conference at Groote Schuur Hospital at 10am, Tuesday, 25 January,” the organisation said.In the Western Cape, the Freesia Ward in Mitchells Plain also received a R10m upgrade from Gift of the Givers.“We are awaiting written confirmation from WC Health to commence upgrades at Eerste River Hospital. We have commenced support for cataract catch-up surgery at Eerste River Hospital and will continue for the rest of 2022.”To donate to Gift of the Givers visit giftofthegivers.org.Cape Times
