The NSRI team then drove the turtle a distance of more than 500km from Hluhluwe to Durban.MORE ON THISPretoria man sounds the alarm on injured sea turtle on KwaZulu-Natal south coastPICS: uShaka Sea World admits first stranded penguin of the yearPICS: Three-flipper turtle rescued off KZN south coastDespite surgery, turtle found tangled in fishing line off Durban beach diesPICS: Turtle's flipper amputated after fishing line caused gangreneKunz said uShaka Sea World staff were prepared for Dhiya’s arrival and had been warned that her condition was poor.“She appeared emaciated and understandably lethargic. She was named Dhiya, which is of Hindu origin, signifying light, goodness and purity,” Kunz said.“Dhiya was given fluids and left to rest in a shallow bath. She remained almost motionless for the next few days and hardly stirred whilst the team took blood samples, performed x-rays and administered fluids.”Kunz said over the last two weeks, although Dhiya had not regained her strength, she has not deteriorated, which was a good sign. She was clearly a fighter.Her radiographs indicated that she had been feeding, and her blood showed good glucose levels and was therefore not starving. She was put on a course of antibiotics which we hope will help her recover.uShaka Sea World senior aquarist Malini Pather said: “We are very grateful to the staff from both Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife and the NSRI for their continued dedication to caring for stranded marine animals and for giving Dhiya the best possible chance of recovery. Although any prediction regarding her survival is guarded, we are continuing to do whatever we can to give her a second chance and trust that she has the capacity to recover.”Daily News
