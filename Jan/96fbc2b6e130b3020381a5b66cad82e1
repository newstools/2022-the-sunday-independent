DURBAN - CRIME that intrudes into our homes and riffles our mattresses to shreds, overturns the dirty laundry, messes up the clean washing, takes sky-walks in our ceiling and turns the geyser upside down looking for jewellery and cash… This leave us underling-VAT-paying citizens no option but to either donate everything to charity and walk all the way to Mecca, Bethlehem or Varanasi to become wealth-free, God-filled sadhus or hide our legal and ill-gotten gains in a bank locker.Previously termed “Man in the Iron Mask- style”, as “vault”. The latest problem however is, like most other business organisations, banks overuse the exponentially multiplying Covid excuses. (“Staff working from home, informal settlement, prison, bathroom, toilet, kitchen.Thank you for your patience!”)There is only one bank with standard features that offers this locker service this side of the Umgeni River. They used to open during normal banking hours, but have now decided to wield a big stick-em-up-stick by proclaiming that the locker services are open only from 9am to 1pm from Mondays to Fridays, Saturdays closed. Access to all lockers are otherwise locked-down which actually means the same thing as locked-up.So how is the average working man or woman to gain access to their lockers? We also hear that this arrangement is not just during the Covid period, but permanent.Is this bank for real or what?We don’t need blackmailing criminals that kidnap young children for ransom, not when we have perfectly legal systems like banks to do just that.Ebrahim Essa, Durban Daily News
