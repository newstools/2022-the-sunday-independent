DURBAN – With the 2022 academic year set to kick off tomorrow, DJ-turned-philanthropist Thulani Mzinyane, has called upon all those who can, to make a difference in the lives of school pupils by donating school uniforms.Mzinyane, who runs a non-profit organisation (NPO) called Isenzo Foundation, said that it was important for all children to have access to education.The philanthropist established his organisation in the year 2012 while living in the township of Clermont.“I established my organisation after realising the shortfalls within the community. Then I approached a couple of business people to assist with donations of food, clothing items and other things. I then registered it in 2018 because I needed to attract sponsorship for my other initiatives,” said Mzinyane.He added that he had been running the drive for uniforms since 2019.  He used to distribute food to needy children from the area, and then decided to branch into uniform donations as well, after seeing a need for it.MORE ON THISCompetition Commission to clamp down on overpriced school uniformsParents hopeful Competition Commission guidelines will make  uniforms more affordableParents panic buy uniforms, stationery as schools openHe added that the pandemic had an impact on what parents could afford.“Covid-19 has played a major role in the unemployment rate among many parents, which means that many can’t afford school uniforms, and the fact that they are sold in a particular place at exorbitant prices make them even more difficult to access.”Mzinyane added that he worked very closely with a team of esteemed social workers in the area to identify those that need the donations.According to Mzinyane, the spirit of Ubuntu should be kept alive. “The spirit of Ubuntu is very close to me. As someone who lost his mother at a young age, I experienced the power of giving, first hand.“We have experienced a lot of struggles, some brought by Covid-19 and some by fate, so this concept is relevant now more than ever. It takes a village to raise a child,” he said.According to senior social worker, Muhle Ngcobo, from the Sibusisiwe Child and Welfare, an NPO that works closely with Mzinyane, the recipients will be local children.“Children from poor backgrounds will be receiving the school uniforms. We work closely with clients from Ward 21 and 22 here in Clermont. Although we take a holistic approach to assisting families, our biggest concern right now is getting our clients back to school in full uniforms,” said Ngcobo..Mzinyane added that those who wishes to help with donations could contact him on Whatsapp on 076 297 4942, or call him on 065 947 4966. Items needed include school shoes, trousers, tunics, shirts, jerseys and school bags.Donors can donate funds or alternatively buy the uniforms and submit it themselves.THE MERCURY
