In the interest of transparency, open governance, and his responsibility to the people of the province, we demand the premier comes clean and plays open cards with us. “We don’t want to speculate on the reasons, we want the truth, and we want it now,” said Dugmore.The ACDP also stated that it will await for further answers from the premier, but also welcome news of an investigation into the situation.“These allegations must be very serious if the premier suspended MEC Fritz with immediate effect. As the ACDP, we welcome the investigation and want to request the premier to inform the public of the outcome of the investigation.“We also believe that a person is innocent until found guilty. As the ACDP we want to congratulate the premier for his speedy response to these serious allegations.”Cape Argus
