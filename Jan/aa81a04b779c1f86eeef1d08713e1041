From Grade 10 when we chose our subjects we started building towards our matric year. From Grade 10 I started working consistently. This allowed me to figure out from early on what study methods work for me. Starting matric I was sure to enforce a solid time management strategy for the year, which helped me balance school, tutorials, study time and, of course, my social life. Balance is indeed the key,” Papavarnava said.When asked what inspired her to be the best version of herself, she said her parents, who sacrificed a lot for her. Papavarnava said she attributes her success to a strong work ethic and the support from her parents.“I’ve always been inspired by my parents.

They have inspired me to always strive for my goals and pursue my dreams despite any obstacles,” the top achiever said.She told The Star that she was proud to have also taken part in cultural activities offered by her school.“I was privileged to co-captain the debate team and set the foundation for the Model United Nations club that has started to take off. Furthermore, during my matric year, I was a part of the public speaking trophy team where we achieved an outstanding score at the end of the competition,” she said.She was part of the Hellenic radio team for a year and participated in Greek dancing, drama house-plays and the social engagement programme (Outreach).She has been provisionally accepted to five universities and will decide between Wits University and UCT to pursue a career in medicine.The Star
