CAPE TOWN - To keep the spirit of the annual Tweede Nuwe Jaar celebrations alive, the Cape Malay Choir Boys and 7 Steps Minstrels hosted a small but powerful demonstration of song, dance and poetry of the long-standing tradition at the Castle of Good Hope on Sunday.This year marks the second year without the traditional Kaapse Klopse carnival being held due to the Covid-19 pandemic. January 2 -  the only day the slaves enjoyed a day off throughout the year - is symbolic in the Cape, also known as "Tweede Nuwe Jaar” and gave rise to the annual Kaapse Klopse celebration of song and dance.This year’s event, made possible through collaboration of The Cape Muslim and Slave Heritage Museum, Castle of Good Hope, 7 Steps Minstrels and Cape Malay Choir Boys, was dedicated to the late Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu. Tutu is honoured in the Struggle heroes’ photographic exhibition in the Cape Muslim and Slave Heritage Museum."There is no way we can have an invisible enemy divide us and kill our culture. We decided to have a small, short but very impactful event every year on the second day of new year as long as Covid is there," said Castle Control Board chief executive Calvyn Gilfellan."We show to the world and local Capetonians that our heritage, culture and history is very important to us. Nothing is going to stop it from growing and being carried over to our new generation, that is the philosophy behind it."Gilfellan said that the Castle was the appropriate place to host the event as it is a symbol of colonial conquest and slavery."It is appropriate that this event in the space where slavery has been abolished in 1934, that the descendants of those slaves come and express all emotions of humanity at a place which caused so much hardship, but also brought so much joy to the hardship," added Gilfellan.Cape Muslim and Slave Heritage Museum curator Igshaan Higgins said Covid-19 has had a massive impact as there is no march through the streets of Darling, Adderley and Wale streets.“Instead we decided to commemorate by having a small group at the Castle to commemorate Tweede Nuwe Jaar," Higgins said."We are restricted in terms of Covid numbers and taking social distance into account.“It is a symbolic gesture from the four organizations symbolizing Tweede Nuwe Jaar as an important day in the calendar of South Africa. It was the day that slaves celebrated a little bit of freedom for one day, we marking that day," Higgins said.Cape Times
