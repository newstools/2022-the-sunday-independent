The Cape Town Cycle Tour is all set for March 13 with a limited field of 22 500 expected and a pre-race Expo confirmed.Last year the Cape Town Cycle Tour was postponed to October 10 as a result of Covid restrictions with a limited field of 18 000.This year organisers have confirmed a larger capacity but Covid protocols will still apply.“After missing out on our traditional March date last year, we are delighted to be back to our usual date in 2022,” event director, David Bellairs said.“Last year we were oversubscribed with our limited field and glad that we can now expand the entry limit to accommodate more riders in 2022.”Organisers also confirmed that the traditional pre-race Expo will go ahead this year after being limited in 2021. The Expo will take place at the Cape Town Stadium as part of the registration process.Details of the registration process are still to be announced but Covid protocols will be in place as was the case in 2021.“The safety of our riders during registration and the race itself is our top priority,” Bellairs said.Last year, Nolan Hoffman became the second most successful men’s rider in Cape Town Cycle Tour history when he won his fourth title in 2 hours, 37 minutes, 12 seconds in near perfect weather.In the Women’s race, 2018 winner Kim Le Court De Billot took the title after a thrilling race over 78km that started in Fish Hoek.
