Cape Town - NGO Ladles of Love has urged people to join its Feed the Soil sustainability programme that addresses both the need for “zero-to-landfill” organic waste and the need for urban farmers to enrich their soil through the use of eco-waste kits.“Feed the Soil aims to promote sustainable development in Cape Town by providing nutrient-rich compost to urban farmers. This addresses both the need for ‘zero-to-landfill’ organic waste and the need for urban farmers to enrich their soil to grow nutritious produce and find a route to market,” said Ladles of Love public relations manager Bianca Prins.Ladles of Love partnered with Zero to Landfill Organics, experts who are passionate about recycling organic waste, to assist with turning the waste collected from suburban households into compost for Cape farmers and gardeners.Prins said this compost was then delivered to urban farmers in impoverished communities to allow them to grow fresh produce to use in soup kitchens and to sell at markets.The organisation meets at the Sunset Beach car park on the Atlantic Seaboard every Wednesday from 8.30am till noon, where people can drop off their waste, swop their bucket for a clean and empty one, and buy fresh produce.MORE ON THISNPO Ladles of Love smashes 50k sandwiches target to feed vulnerable Cape communitiesGrandWest spends millions on social enterprise development and corporate investment projectsLadles of Love celebrates women who are supporting their communities“The meeting point is a one-stop drop, swop and shop space,” said Prins.Feed the Soil eco-waste kits.
