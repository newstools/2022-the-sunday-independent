CAPE TOWN - The Department of Basic Education (DBE) says it will abide by the Pretoria High Court judgment which ordered that it publish the 2021 matric results on all public platforms.Publications of results will continue to reflect as they did in 2020, where only exam numbers will show instead of candidates’ names and surnames.National Senior Certificate (NSC) results are expected to be released on Friday.Lobby group AfriForum took Minister Angie Motshekga and the DBE to court over the decision not to publish the NSC results on media and public platforms including newspapers, saying doing so would violate the Protection of Personal Information Act (Popia) of 2013.On Tuesday Judge Anthony Millar said not everyone has access to the internet and some candidates no longer live in the area where their high school is based and might not be able to access their results timeously or even at all.DBE spokesperson Elijah Mahlangu said the ruling means the department will make available the results to stakeholders who request access.“The conditions of the court ruling must be taken into account in line with the provisions of the Popia. In addition to accessing results from media platforms, the department urges candidates to register on the website to view the results when they become available,"  Mahlangu said. Cape Times
