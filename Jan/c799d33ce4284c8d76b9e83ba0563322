DURBAN - The Institute of Waste Management of Southern Africa (IWMSA) has acknowledged the role played by waste pickers and said they deserved more recognition for their environmental contribution.The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research stated that in 2014 alone informal pickers saved municipalities between R309 million and R748m in landfill airspace. This by simply diverting recyclables from landfills.According to the Waste Pickers Association, South Africa has more than 90 000 waste pickers. The IWMSA said waste pickers were viewed as an “irritation” by many who see them going through their rubbish bins.Mpendulo Ginindza, vice-president of IWMSA, said instead of getting annoyed, people should be thankful for the difference these pickers made in our environment and economy. Ginindza said it was estimated that a single picker can divert between 16 and 24 tons of waste each year.“Plastics SA reported in 2018 that the majority of recyclable plastic collected was sourced from formal collectors. Formal collectors typically source their recyclables from waste pickers and buy-and-drop centres.”MORE ON THISNew innovative technology set to revolutionise recycling sectorFrom the president’s desk: ’Let us all play our part in the fight against climate change’Report lifts lid on lack of protection, training for waste pickersGinindza defined a waste picker as someone who collected reusable and recyclable materials from residential and commercial waste bins, landfill sites and open spaces to revalue them and generate an income.She said waste pickers worked in a rural or urban environment, sorting through bins and transporting heavy waste on trolleys.“Often, they don’t have the proper equipment, and environmental conditions are not safe; not to mention what they come across in the bins,” she said.Ginindza pointed out that many waste pickers were informal workers, and a number of municipalities had attempted to integrate informal workers, but with mixed success rates.She also pointed to the waste pickers integration guideline for South Africa, produced by the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries in 2020.“It provides guidance to municipalities and industry on measures to improve their working conditions.”She said legislation also played a role.“In May 2021, the extended producer responsibility regulations came into effect. Its purpose is support, recognition and compensation for the work that is done by pickers along the waste value chain.”She advised residents to separate their waste at home and at work.Daily News
