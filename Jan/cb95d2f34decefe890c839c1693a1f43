CAPE TOWN - Athlone High School celebrated its 75th anniversary - or diamond jubilee - this week with an event that focused on the rich history of the school.The institution is known for its rich historical background dating back to its inauguration in January 1947, when only two other high schools for oppressed people existed in the Cape.The school's first principal was Sydney Vernon Petersen, who was also one of the first people of colour to graduate from UCT.Today the school is under the leadership of its fifth principal, Vincent Hendricks, who took the reins in 2018. He said it was a great honour  for him to be leading the school in this historical period marking 75 years of the school’s existence.“It is very humbling and a great honour for me to be leading the school during this milestone year. The school has come to mean everything to me and I want to be totally committed by giving my best to the school,” Hendricks said.The celebratory event on Monday was hosted by ex-principal Howard Mackrill, while Peterson’s son, Sydney Petersen jr, proposed a toast.A photographic exhibition displayed images from the early decades of the school, featuring the various athletics teams, drama groups, the rugby and soccer teams as well as class photos. The event was filled with cultural items including dancing and the recitation of Shakespearean work with some current pupils participating.Hendricks said the school has had a number of remarkable learners over the years in attendance. In 1977, the top two matric learners in the country - Christopher Swartz and Peter Smith - attended Athlone High.“We want to promote ourselves as a very inclusive school where we celebrate different faiths and cultures and promote a sense of belonging. We encourage them (learners) to aim high, we want to give them a very good education from Grade 8 to Grade 12,” Hendricks said.The school governing body (SGB) reviewed and updated all important school policies last year, Hendricks said, and there was no fee increase, with the Covid-19 pandemic being a pertinent contextual factor.This year, the SGB and staff will go all out to ensure that the school obtains a 100% matric pass rate, Hendricks said. “We will achieve this through dynamic teaching, inspiration, motivation, mentoring, revision lessons and career expos.“ The school will host an interfaith thanksgiving service on March 22, also in celebration of its 75th year.Cape Times
