CAPE TOWN  - The Cape Town Carnival is set to return in March to once again showcase the creativity and talent of the people of Cape Town.The much-anticipated event is set to return on March 19 and will host five consecutive shows that will celebrate the diverse cultures and stories of Cape Town.The Carnival’s chief executive Jay Douwes said this year’s event would move festival-goers like never before.“Visitors will get to curate their own experience as they move between five distinct outdoor Carnival Hubs across the city."They will get to explore the city, its streets, restaurants and galleries, while enjoying vibrant performances, installations and attractions,” Douwes said.The hub format also means the Carnival can adapt to evolving regulations, such as the number of people allowed in a venue.The hubs will be sanitised before every show and visitors will be screened on entry, with compulsory mask-wearing in place.Professor Rachel Jafta, chairperson of the Cape Town Carnival Trust said “we're driven by the fundamental belief in the power of creativity.”Cape Town mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis, said: “As you move between the hubs, grab a bite, drink a coffee at local eateries, or pop into shops and galleries who will be celebrating along with us. Expect specials, activations and more, as that Carnival energy ripples through the city streets. “Outdoor dining, open-air experiences, and the reimagined Carnival Hubs, we’re excited to bring people together and support local businesses in a Covid-safe way.”The Carnival has historically been a free event, but this time, you’ll need to confirm attendance and supply Covid-19 track-and-trace info by purchasing a R10 ticket per show.To find out more, visit capetowncarnival.comTickets can be booked at capetowncarnival.comCape Times
