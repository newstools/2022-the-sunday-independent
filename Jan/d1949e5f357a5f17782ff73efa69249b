Picture: Ahmed Motala Motala said Karodia knew first-hand the level of literacy in the country and wanted to leave a lasting legacy.Motala said that at the time, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga had already started her own literacy initiative called the “Read to Lead” campaign, to boost literacy levels.“These stunning mobile libraries can be wheeled from one class to another, making reading easily accessible to learners by taking the libraries to them. The main focus of this initiative is at primary school level, as studies have shown that if a child cannot read for meaning at Grade 4 level, the chances of him or her finishing matric and gaining access to tertiary education will be very remote.”Motala said Karodia’s legacy lived on and the current principal, Ntombela, together with the Yusuf Karodia Foundation, have taken over the baton to ensure that the distribution of libraries and books continues.Daily News
