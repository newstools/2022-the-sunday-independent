CAPE TOWN - A Langa mother entered the new year in grief after her 17-year-old son who had been eagerly awaiting his matric results to be issued later this month, was stabbed to death.Bonteheuwel High School pupil Wisdom Anyawu was attacked by a man allegedly over a lighter a few minutes after the countdown to midnight.According to his mother, Thobeka Anyawu, the suspect approached the teen and his friends on the road.“The man was passing when he saw the boys and requested a lighter for his cigarette. The friends said none of them had one and apparently my son, who was carrying his, offered to light up the cigarette for him. “Wisdom didn’t hand it to him, because he apparently rudely questioned why my son wanted to light the cigarette for him instead of giving him the lighter. He came closer to Wisdom and stabbed him in the chest.”Anyawu said at first the friends thought the man had punched the teen in the chest.“He walked up to his friends and showed them he was actually stabbed and not beaten. They came to report the incident and he was rushed to the hospital,” she said.Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said circumstances leading to the incident where a teenager was stabbed and died at a medical facility at about 2.30am were under investigation.A murder docket was opened by Langa police.Anyawu said her son had a bright future ahead of him.She took to Facebook to share her pain and requested assistance for funeral arrangements. “I’m shattered. He was so young, full of life and a hard worker. He was not a troublesome child. I have never heard bad reports about him from residents here. People admired his kindness and respect for elders.“We were looking forward to his results and what will be the next move from then. He was so excited.”To support the Anyawu family with a burial for their son contact Thobeka on 065 694 7565.Anyone with any information about this incident can anonymously contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111.Cape Times
