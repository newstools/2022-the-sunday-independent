Cape Town - A Masiphumele hawker is facing criminal charges for animal cruelty following the confiscation of more than 100 chickens by the Good Hope SPCA and Law enforcement on the weekend.The operation, which was carried out after the organisation obtained a court order follows after what SPCA said were failed attempts to educate the hawker on humane handling, transportation, and safekeeping of the chickens.The organisation said several warnings were issued, seeking to remedy the contravention in terms of the Animal Protection Act and this fell on deaf ears.Law enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason confirmed that 142 chickens were removed from the premises in the joint operation with the SPCA.COGH SPCA spokesperson Belinda Abrahams said charges would be laid this week.MORE ON THISHanover Park hamster horde rescued after owner 'couldn’t keep up' with their rampant breedingLeaving your dog in a hot car can be fatal, SPCA warns ahead of Cape’s scorching weekendCape dog owners urged to stop feeding their pets bonesAbrahams said on arrival inspectors and law-enforcement officials found the chickens held in overcrowded crates without access to food, water, or shade. Abrahams said several of the chickens were found already dead while others were still alive, but were severely dehydrated and beyond saving. She said some needed to be humanely euthanised.“Despite the tremendous loss of life and prolonged suffering, inspectors managed to save a large number of the chickens with emergency interventions on-site,” she said.The City Animal Keeping By-Law 2021 prohibits the sale of an animal without the City's authorisation in streets or public space, from a movable structure or vehicle, at public markets, and online.SPCA chief inspector Jaco Pieterse Pieterse said businesses and individuals in receipt of a warning issued by an inspector should err on the side of caution. He said many continued to underestimate the powers of the SPCA and its inspectors.SA Informal Traders Alliance president Rashieda Muller said the alliance was intending to look at the matter. Muller said their concern as the informal sector and vulnerable workers was the passing of laws and by-laws by local government without awareness or education to hawkers.“They say the informal sector is an important part of the economy and needs to have an enabling environment, yet there isn't a stakeholder forum where we can discuss as a sector on how we can assist government in the implementation of the laws and by-laws that we believe are in the interest and growth and development of the informal sector,” said Muller.mthuthuzeli.ntseku@inl.co.zaCape Argus
