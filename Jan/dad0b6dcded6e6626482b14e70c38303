CAPE TOWN - A George man who killed his girlfriend after she refused to have sexual intercourse with him has been sentenced to 15 years behind bars.Collin Heyns was sentenced in the George Magistrate’s Court after he was convicted for Esmeralda Botha’s murder.Heyns was accused of killing Botha on June 4, 2020 in their house in the Rosedale informal settlement in Pacaltsdorp.Neighbours had ignored her calls for help as they were used to domestic violence in the household and they believed it would eventually quieten down.Heyns fled the house after committing the murder, leaving their 6-year-old child, who witnessed the murder, with the body of the mother.The body was discovered the next morning and the accused handed himself over to the police later that same day.During the trial, he pleaded not guilty but the court found that he had direct intent to kill Botha and handed him a 15 years direct imprisonment sentence,which is the prescribed minimum sentence.National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Western Cape spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the NPA was satisfied with the verdict and welcomed the sentence.In another case, the mother of slain Chantell Matthyssen, Carol Petersen, said it felt as if the “wheels of justice are not just turning slowly, it feels like they have fallen off”, after another delay in trial proceedings against accused Wellington serial killer, Johan Williams.Matthyssen’s body was found at Abenrau Farm in Wellington on July 2, 2018. She had allegedly been lured with the promise of employment by Williams, who had been a family friend.Williams appeared in the Western Cape High Court on Friday last week where trial proceedings were set to get under way, but were then postponed to April 11.Cape Times
