CAPE TOWN - A suspected hijacker was shot dead when he allegedly attempted to rob an off-duty officer of his vehicle in Khayelitsha on Monday.The incident involving the 19-year-old suspect took place in Japhta K Masemola Road, an area Site B residents described as a hots pot for hijackings due to potholes.Police spokesperson Joseph Swartbooi said: “Two unknown suspects approached the driver of a vehicle, pointing him with firearms. The driver then fired gunshots at the suspects, fatally wounding the 19-year-old male, whilst the other suspect fled the scene. “The victim was declared deceased on the scene by the medical personnel. The motive for the attack was a robbery. Khayelitsha police registered an attempted murder and an inquest for further investigation.”Describing the hijacking attempt, a witness told the Cape Times: “The car slowed down because there are potholes in the area, especially when you approach the robots. All of a sudden, I saw two guys both carrying guns approaching the car and I immediately reversed my car because I had fear that they might come to me. “As they were approaching the car, they were shouting at the driver to get out of the car and without any hesitation, the guy (driver) pulled out a gun and shot at one of the guys who was coming straight to the driver’s side.“As he was coming out to deal with the second guy, he (the suspect) was already gone with their car which was parked by the side of the road,” said the witness.Anyone with information about the incident can anonymously contact Crime Stop at 08600 10111 or SMS Crime Line at 32211.Cape Times
