Clover respects the right of employees to strike in a peaceful and legal manner but strongly condemns any violence, intimidation and damage to property that has been linked to the ongoing industrial action.“The company has a Labour Court interdict ruling against such unlawful conduct and has enhanced security measures to protect employees and its assets. All unlawful acts will be investigated, and legal action will be taken against the perpetrators.”The company has been hit by a strike since November with workers protesting over wage cuts, retrenchments and corporate restructuring.In a statement, the company said Clover Proprietary Limited had been subjected to a difficult trading cycle for several years, where economic growth had been poor, costs had generally been rising above inflation and consumer spending had been subdued. It added that Covid-19 had added to these pressures and the uncertainty.“For these reasons, a comprehensive strategic review of all aspects of Clover’s business was undertaken, which led to the difficult decision to restructure. Unfortunately, as part of this restructure and as a matter of last resort, a Section 189 consultation process was implemented,” said the company.“Working with the South African Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), Clover explored all possible avenues to minimise retrenchments and ensured a process that was fair and in accordance with all legal requirements.“Concurrent to the Section 189 process, Clover has been engaging representative bodies regarding the annual wage review since April 2021. On November 9, 2021, Clover made a final offer of a backdated 4.5% increase in wages, effective 1 July 2021, but this was rejected. Negotiations subsequently broke down and unionised employees embarked on a national strike on November 22,” said the company.Clover said it was committed to resolving the matter in a constructive manner. “All discussions will be considered in context of the business’ financial position and longer-term sustainability, which is to the benefit of all stakeholders.”THE MERCURY
