Over the years, there have been numerous incidents, resulting in several people being killed and others scarred for life. Lizzy Humbelani Mudzanani's death earlier this month has reminded the world just how deadly these creatures can be.A research paper that looks at crocodile attacks in South Africa and Eswatini between 1949 and 2016, paints a scary picture.The paper – by Simon Pooley, Hannes Botha, Xander Combrink and George Powell, published in 2019 – looked at 214 attacks over this period.It found that most occurred in natural water bodies, with attacks in dams increasing since 2000. It further found that most victims were attacked while swimming or bathing, followed by fishing, doing domestic chores and crossing rivers.It also found there was a strong relationship between crocodile attacks and the season, following fluctuations in average monthly rainfall and average monthly minimum temperature.A total of 190 of the recorded attacks included mention of what the victim was doing at the time. Of these, 31% were attacked while swimming or bathing; 22% while fishing; 18% while doing domestic chores at the water's edge; 16%  while crossing a body of water; and, 13% while engaged in other activities in or close to the water.Below is a timeline of some of the attacks over the past seven years.January 2016Kelly Traueinicht bitten on the arm while fishing at Selati River.
