CAPE TOWN - The Department of Public Works and Infrastructure (DPWI) has yet to respond to allegations that it was negligent in failing to maintain public buildings such as courts and prisons.The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services last week accused the DPWI of negligence, with committee chairperson Bulelani Magwanishe also raising questions over the impact of the alleged negligence on national security.The committee, in a statement, said they resolved to summon the DPWI to Parliament to respond to the complaints.The committee visited the Barberton Correctional Centre and Community Corrections as part of its week-long oversight visit to courts and correctional centres, to assess correctional centres’ rehabilitation, skills development and integration programmes.According to the statement, the committee heard complaints about the lack of maintenance at facilities including fire extinguishers that have been allowed to expire or have not been serviced.Magwanishe said: “What will happen if there is a fire and prisoners die here? What is the perception about South Africa going to be? We don’t want another Life Esidimeni. We are going to be very hard on DPWI. We will invite the Director-General to explain why there are these types of complaints about court buildings and prisons, while there are people employed every day.”The department committed to address some of the challenges using emergency interventions, which often require deviations from normal procurement processes.The committee heard that because there were no long-term maintenance plans, ad hoc work was done, which often required emergency procurement.The portfolio committee questioned the financial implications of the on-going use of emergency interventions.“So the tendency is to always throw money at every problem instead of looking at our own capacity. The financial challenges of the country are being complicated by us not being innovative. It is not fair for South Africans to sustain negligence and laziness,” said Magwanishe.Enquiries to DPWI to respond to the allegations and complaints were not answered by deadline. Cape Times
