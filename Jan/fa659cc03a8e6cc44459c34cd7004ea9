It was just the staff left, who had the situation under control,” he said.The mamba was hiding behind boards which the staff had placed up against the entrance to the changeroom, he said.MORE ON THISMozambique spitting cobra sinks fangs into woman’s toe as she opens the fridgeAfter killing 4 rats on a chicken farm, Black Mambas praised for controlling Durban’s large rodent populationLarge Mozambique Spitting Cobra sprays venom in Westville woman’s eyes after she opened a cupboard at workA big 2.3 metre black mamba was caught inside the changeroom of a Chatsworth school.

In its panic, it dashed up a shrub, then down and headed to these boards,” he said.Evans said the school grounds were not a place he would expect to find a mamba as it was very neat and sparse. “There was a big patch of bush next to the school, so it was probably trying to get to the other side of the school in search of food, or maybe it just got a bit confused,” he said.A big 2.3 metre black mamba was caught inside the changeroom of a Chatsworth school.
