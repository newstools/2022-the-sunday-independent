Rustenburg – A tavern owner was shot and wounded during a robbery in Jouberton, near Klerksdorp, in the North West. Eight men entered a tavern in extension 23 in Jouberton just before midnight on Saturday, and allegedly fired shots randomly. Said North West police spokesperson Colonel Adele Myburgh: "It is alleged that the suspects entered a tavern, threatened patrons and fired a few shots randomly, before robbing some of them (patrons) of their cellular phones. " A 42-year-old tavern owner was instructed to open the cash register and upon refusing, he was shot in the stomach and admitted at a local hospital, where he is in a stable condition. No other injuries were reported." . She said the gunmen proceeded to break open a security door, leading to the owner’s house and, after a search, took an undisclosed amount of cash and fled to a nearby field where they got into two vehicles, a white Toyota Quantum minibus taxi and a white bakkie.
