Media personality and businesswoman Lerato Kganyago is seething with rage after controversial blogger Musa Khawula called her the “lite” version of Queen B, Bonang Matheba.  Taking to Twitter recently, Khawula wrote: “Bonang Lite at the #DurbanJuly”, with a picture of Kganyago dressed to attend the HollywoodBets Durban July.

He gave examples of “Live Amp” and Metro FM’s “The Bridge”.    remember when bonang was at live amp? guess who to her job right after?do you also remember when bonang left her job on metro fm doing the bridge? babes guess who took that job?guess who will replace bonang at any other job that she leaves?bonang lite,xo xo,gossip girl Taking huge offence to the tweets, Kganyago came hard at Khawula, asking him to not be disrespectful. She even pulled out personal files on Khawula from years ago, stating that he has a criminal record and hides in his grandmother’s basement. “Criticise but don’t disrespect me @MusaKhawula. Many years ago I let you slide with your bullying and you KNOW who had sent you. You’ve got criminal charges from 2013,  of Drug Trafficking, robbery, you’ve BEEN convicted (Just to name a few) to deal with,” read her  tweet.
