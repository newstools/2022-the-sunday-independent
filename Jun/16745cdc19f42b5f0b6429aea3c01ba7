According to Sputnik News, 523 more cases have been confirmed since its previous update on May 29, with the new figures indicating a 203% increase in the incidence of the virus. "As of 2 June 2022, there have been no deaths associated within the current monkeypox outbreak in non-endemic countries. However, cases and deaths continue to be reported from endemic countries," the statement read. On May 7, the UK Health Security Agency became the first health authority outside Africa to publicly report a case of monkeypox in a patient who had travelled to Nigeria. And since then, the outbreak has been confirmed in various countries across Europe, Australia and North America. The BBC reported that the UK currently has the most cases with 207, Spain followed with 156 and Portugal with 138 confirmed cases. The WHO added that most confirmed cases reported travel to countries in Europe and North America, rather than West or Central Africa, where the monkeypox virus is endemic. “The confirmation of monkeypox in persons who have not travelled to an endemic area is atypical, and even one case of monkeypox in a non-endemic country is considered an outbreak,” the WHO said. “It is highly likely that other countries will identify cases, and there will be further spread of the virus,” it added.
