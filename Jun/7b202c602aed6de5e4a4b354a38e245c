Durban – KwaZulu-Natal communities hard hit by the April and May floods will be provided with much-needed food hampers and water by food relief organisation Food For Life South Africa (FFLSA), in partnership with the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC). The partnership will provide 1700 food hampers to deserving families in impacted households in Newcastle, Estcourt, Ladysmith, oThongathi, La Mercy and Shakaskraal. In addition to the food hampers, 2.4 million litres of potable water will be distributed to areas of eThekwini and iLembe districts, where water supply has been disrupted for an extended period of time. “The IDC is deeply concerned about the well-being and safety of families and businesses affected by the floods. We are certain that our partnership with Food for Life South Africa will alleviate the challenges faced by affected communities,” said Tshepo Ramodibe, the IDC’s head of corporate affairs. The long-term impact of the floods on infrastructure, homes and businesses meant that many households were still unable to meet their basic needs because of loss of income, homes and access to water, Food For Life SA said. “The effects of the flood, coupled with those of the Covid-19 pandemic, have seen the disruption of food security and these relief efforts support Food For Life SA’s mission to create a hunger-free society, ” said Yoshan Baboolal, CEO of Food For Life SA.
