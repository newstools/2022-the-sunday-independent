CAPE TOWN - Blood stocks are critically low in the Western Cape, and the Western Cape Blood Service (WCBS) has appealed to people to donate as soon as possible.“Currently, we only have a two-day blood supply in O blood groups and a three-day supply of A+ and B+,” said Marike Gevers, public relations manager at the blood service.“We aim to maintain a five-day blood stock supply in all blood groups,” she said.The WCBS encouraged all blood donors to find their closest blood donation clinic and save up to three lives with one donation.“Each donor that successfully donates a unit of blood in March will receive a limited-edition WCBS face mask. To find your closest blood donation clinic, please download the WCBS app on Android and iOS, send us a WhatsApp on 060 549 7244 or visit Where Can I Donate.“If you are between the ages of 16 and 75, weigh 50kg or more, are in good general health, and lead a safe sexual lifestyle, you should be able to donate. Blood donation takes 30 minutes of your time and you can donate every 56 days,” the blood service said.Red blood cells are used to replace losses as a result of accidents, trauma, childbirth and surgery, as well as for burn victims.They are also essential in the treatment of various kinds of anaemia linked to cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as sickle cell anaemia.These essential cells must be used within 42 days of donation if fresh, but can also be frozen for longer periods.Cape Times
