DURBAN - KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala launched a R340-million housing project in the uMkhanyakude District Municipality on Tuesday. Zikalala and Human Settlements and Public Works MEC Jomo Sibiya and local leaders visited the municipality to assess the progress of the Mdletshe Rural Housing Project.Speaking to the community of uMkhanyakude at the Macabuzana Sports Ground, Zikalala said to enable the roll-out of human settlements across the province an integrated approach including all levels of government was needed.“We have taken a deliberate decision to use the construction of houses as a catalyst for local economic development and job creation for local communities. We insist that local emerging contractors are prioritised as part of driving radical economic transformation through the roll-out of human settlements.”Zikalala said the expanded public works programme will ensure the training and employment of local youth during the construction.

When completed in March 2024, the phase 2 Mdletshe Housing Project will have produced more than 2 500 flats.Zikalala said the provincial government is implementing the KZN Water Master Plan in order to address major water challenges plaguing uMkhanyakude District and other municipalities.“We want to see all human settlement projects in the province being completed within budget. Delays in the construction of houses is a thing of the past. This provincial government will not hesitate to revoke developer status from municipalities that are failing to deliver houses to our people,” said Zikalala.Daily News
