CAPE TOWN - In a win for small-scale fishers, Searcher has officially been interdicted from continuing its seismic survey off the West and South-West coast of South Africa, pending the outcome of a legal challenge of the permit it was granted to do so.West Coast communities and environmental activists had approached the court for the interdict arguing the survey in the absence of consultation posed an immediate risk to marine and bird life, as well as to the communities who relied on the ocean for their livelihoods and food sources.Judge Daniel Thulare of the Western Cape High Court found: “A proper consultation has significant material results for fishers. No attempt was made to meet with small-scale fishers of the West Coast. The communities and individuals who were impacted and were likely to be impacted by the survey had a right to be consulted."Searcher had maintained it had consulted affected parties and argued that there was no “hard evidence as to the effect of the survey” and if the interdict was granted they would have to cancel the project in its entirety, resulting in a loss of approximately R405 million.Thulare said all the communities were asking for was proper compliance with the law."(Searcher) are interdicted from continuing the seismic survey of the West and South-West Coast of South Africa in terms of a Reconnaissance Permit granted by the First Respondent on  May 18 2021 in terms of section 74 of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, 2002 (MPRDA) pending the outcome of the applicants' internal appeal against the decision to grant the Reconnaissance Permit to the third and fourth respondents in terms of section 96 of the MPRDA; and the outcome of Part B of this application," he ruled.Cape Times
