O- can be transfused to all blood groups and O+ can be transfused to all positive blood groups.WCBS public relations manager Marike Gevers said blood collections continue to be challenging, while blood usage has increased markedly since the beginning of February.MORE ON THISWestern Cape Blood Service launches its biggest donation campaign ahead of ChristmasUrgent call for blood donations in Western Cape amid the decline in blood supplyPlea to ’keep world beating’ on World Blood Donor Day“After the voluntary blood donation, units are transported to the nearest WCBS office for testing and processing. Blood is spun down and separated into three key components, namely red blood cells, plasma and platelets. “Each unit of blood is tested for HIV, hepatitis B & C, syphilis and blood group. Once blood and blood products are cleared, it is sent to blood banks and emergency blood fridges in hospitals where it is kept for patients in need,” Gevers said.Individuals between the ages 16 and 75, weigh 50kg or more, are in good general health, and lead a safe sexual lifestyle, are eligible to donate blood.Each donor who successfully donates a unit of blood in March will receive a limited-edition WCBS face mask.shakirah.thebus@inl.co.zaCape Argus
