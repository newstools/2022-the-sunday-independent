CAPE TOWN - The Kannaland municipality has launched an investigation into the tragic death of a 5-year-old boy who fell and drowned in the municipal sewage treatment dam last week.Little Rushian Rootman from Zoar has been called a hero after he is believed to have slipped and fallen into the sewage water while helping his friend out of the dam last Wednesday.The community has expressed shock and anger over the incident and accused the municipality of not having the correct measures in place to prevent such incidents in the area. Residents had jumped into the contaminated water to retrieve Rushian.Rushian Rootman While the family declined to comment, Councillor Hyrin Ruiters said Rushian’s mother, Maria Rootman, was inconsolable.“The mother is broken, she does not want to speak to anyone. She is still trying to come to terms with her son’s death.“The community is very angry about this incident and we are all praying with the Rootman family,” Ruiters said.Rushian’s teacher, Meryl Daniels, described him as a “well-mannered” boy.Daniels said they understood Rushian slipped after he pulled out a friend who had fallen into the dam.“He saved his friend out of the dam and when he put him down he took a step back and fell. They were four boys.“They also tried to help him, they gave him a stick but he couldn’t reach it and he went down. Rushian died a hero,” said Daniels.Police spokesperson Captain Malcolm Pojie said Ladismith SAPS is investigating.“It is alleged that the deceased boy and some friend gained access to the waste water treatment facility situated in Braklaagte in Zoar near Ladismith.“Somehow the boy got trapped in the waste water and drowned. Police responded rapidly at about 4.15pm on February 23, after being informed by community members who themselves got exposed after they recovered the body from the dam.“The circumstances surrounding the incident are under investigation. An autopsy will be done to determine the direct cause of death,” Pojie said.Kannaland mayor Nicolaas Valentyn conveyed his condolences to the family.Valentyn said the treatment works were vandalised over several years, with nearly all of the fence stolen.He said the municipality will assist the family with burial support and other needs where possible, and safety measures surrounding the municipal infrastructure and municipal sites will be addressed as a matter of urgency.“The municipality was informed that members of the public stormed the scene of the drowning. The SAPS and municipal law enforcement tried to stop them from entering due to the extreme safety and health risk when exposed to untreated raw wastewater.“Several men jumped into the sewer pond to fetch the young boy without proper protective clothing and possibly exposed themselves to serious health risks.“We urge those who have exposed themselves to please visit a hospital or clinic if they experience any symptoms. Health risks of sewage exposure can have an immediate effect on the human body,” he said. Cape Times
