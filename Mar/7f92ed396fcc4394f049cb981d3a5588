CAPE TOWN - A local entrepreneur has big plans to take her Mopani worms to kitchens across the world.Inspired by her Tsonga roots, Wendy Vesela-Ntimbani founded Matomani in November last year.Wendy Vesela-NtimbaniThe proudly South African company uses Mopani worms to provide consumers with a sustainable, low-impact, organic, healthy and protein-rich addition to their diets while creating employment within her community.“Mopani worms were created by a need to contribute to food security. It is believed that by 2050 there is going to be a shortage of food globally, so the solution to that is consuming insects and also looking at the Greenhouse gases that are generated by livestock, Mopani is an alternative.”Matomani manages their supply chain and harvests their own Mopani worms.It also works closely with people in the community where the Mopani grow to give them an opportunity to trade.Mopani worms contain about 60% protein and are rich in iron, calcium and phosphorus making them a healthy protein alternative.The Matomani range includes premium, hand-picked Mopani worms, Mopani flour and Mopani biscuits.Ntimbani hopes to have a Mopani protein bar before the end of this year.“Business has been amazing because the Mopani are insects, I have been amazed by how much people are excited and supporting. The people are supporting, which is fantastic.”Ntimbani said she was ready to export and work with distributors in countries such as China,Taiwan and the Thailand market as well as the US and Europe.To find out more about Matomani go to www.matomani.co.za.Cape Times
