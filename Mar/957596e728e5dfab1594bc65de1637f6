CAPE TOWN - CAPENature, the Cape of Good Hope SPCA, and the City of Cape Town has made a joint decision to have Scott, the young dispersing male baboon removed from the Cape Peninsula.They’ve invited organisations to apply to translocate the young dispersing male baboon from the Smitswinkel Bay troop to a suitable wildlife facility outside of the Western Cape.Two recent attempts at relocating Scott, or SWB12, to the Da Gama troop were unsuccessful.Interested organisations will have until March 11 to apply for a permit to translocate the baboon.“SWB12 left his natal troop in October 2021. Unfortunately, he failed to integrate with the Da Gama troop on two occasions. The first relocation attempt was on December 21, 2021, and the second on February 23.“Since then he has been spending all of his time in Simon’s Town and surrounds, increasingly displaying raiding behaviour,” the organisations jointly said.The joint decision was based on the following:SWB12 is exposed to many dangers in the urban environment such as dogs, traffic, and hostility from some residents.Two recent attempts to have him relocated have not succeeded.Attempts to keep SWB12 in his natural environment have been increasingly futile.“If no applications are received, or none is successful, CapeNature, the Cape of Good Hope SPCA, and the City of Cape Town will reconvene as soon as possible to decide the future of the baboon, under the leadership of CapeNature.“In the meantime, the City’s service provider, NCC Environmental Services, will keep on monitoring SWB12.“CapeNature, the CGHSPCA, and the City are calling on residents, the general public, and stakeholders to please not follow, or interfere with SWB12 in any way.“The public is also reminded that the feeding of wild animals is prohibited by law,” the joint statement said.Cape Times
