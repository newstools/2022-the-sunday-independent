CAPE TOWN - Some young Clifton Lifesaving Club lifeguards have come out to share their trauma following a drowning incident where their seniors were allegedly nowhere to be found and an oxygen cylinder was empty.The teenagers, who asked not to be named for fear of victimisation, spoke out following calls for the club to take accountability and for the incident, where a young medical student from Mozambique drowned on February 13, to be probed.“We saw people calling for help and at the scene it was just us juniors. We looked for the squad leader but no one could find him and the other one, because we have two (squad leaders), was in the boat shed sleeping. None of us knew what to do, we are all under the age of 18 and never had the experience to assist a drowning person.“We resorted to calling a lifeguard from the City who was not on duty and took the man out of the water with his friend. A few minutes later our leader returned and we thought he would give us some sort of guidance but nothing. He didn’t seem to know what to do,” said the teen.He also mentioned that during the panic, they tried to make use of equipment to assist but noticed that the oxygen tank was empty.“The (Bag-Valve-Mask) to assist the person to breath was also not working properly so it did not provide enough oxygen.”Another teen said that the Lifesaving Club officials had informed them the incident would be probed and their statements taken, however that did not happen.“We are all still trying to come to terms with the incident. Some of the team members are still traumatised and don’t feel like they want to come back. We all feel bad that we could’ve maybe saved the man if we had experience and the guidance we needed. Nothing has been done to address what happened so that it doesn’t happen again in future. No one has been held reliable.”While the Clifton Lifesaving Club did not respond to questions by deadline, a source close to the organisation said all the teens “panicked” and were “overwhelmed by the situation”.“Some even broke down in tears on the scene while CPR was being performed by the non-Clifton voluntary lifeguards.“The scene was chaotic with a lack of proper equipment, no leadership and late response from the on-duty lifeguards who were not present. As a result, the time of death for the patient was called at roughly 3.30pm by paramedics after they arrived on the scene.”“Many of the parents of the children who now face post-traumatic stress disorder are outraged and looking to the Lifesaving Club to take action but unfortunately, there has been nothing short of cover-up taking place.”Cape Times
