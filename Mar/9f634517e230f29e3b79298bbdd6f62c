CAPE TOWN - Money moving company, G4S Cash Solutions, has offered a reward of up to R1 million for useful information leading to the arrest, prosecution and conviction of suspects who shot and killed one of their security guards on January 25 at the Mnandi’s Spar, on Tulip Road in Centurion.The G4S guard was loading a secure cross-pavement cash collection unit into the armoured vehicle when he was accosted and shot with an R5 rifle.The suspects absconded with the cash device, but were unable to access any cash as the security technology installed across G4S devices is aimed at rendering the money unusable."Two of the perpetrators were caught on CCTV, wearing distinctive clothing. Anyone with information is urged to contact: Ray Barlow on 083 324 3460, or Shaun Maleo on 083 750 4042 from G4S Cash Solutions."This information can be shared anonymously, or on the record."Kevin Govender, CIT Director for G4S Cash Solutions, said: “We are devastated at this tragic and senseless loss, and have conveyed our deepest condolences to the family of the deceased, as well as ensuring that the family is well looked after.   We are making it a priority to ensure these criminals are held to account.The company has, over the course of the past few years, invested significantly in upgrading its existing armoured fleet and cross-pavement devices with a range of world-class CIT-mitigation technologies which renders all cash unusable.“Cash-In-Transit (CIT) and cross-pavement attacks are becoming more violent in nature.  This is deeply concerning, because it puts the lives of our people in danger.  In addition, these senseless attacks are futile as the technology we use means any cash stolen is completely unusable.  Our message to would-be criminals is clear - don’t bother attacking our teams because you will get away with nothing of value,” says Govender. Cape Times
