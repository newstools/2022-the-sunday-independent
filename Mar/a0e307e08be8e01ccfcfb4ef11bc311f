Now we have bought a site at Maqongqo and that is where we buried my father’s remains,” Mazibuko said.She expressed shock at what is happening at the cemetery and said she did not understand how a person could build a house next to graves.Zuma Sikhanyiso from KwaPata, who has been fighting the matter for several years, said he did not understand why the Msunduzi Municipality was not dealing with it as it started in 2018.“There was a house being built next to my father’s grave and I was able to stop that from happening.“The sad thing is that people continue to do as they please in the cemetery by building houses.“We have been waiting for the municipality to come back to us to say the houses being built there will be demolished,” said Sikhanyiso.Bernard Mtolo said if he knew how to go about having his wife’s remains removed from the cemetery, he would do it because the situation was getting worse.Acting spokesperson at Msunduzi Municipality Ntobeko Mkhize said the municipality was aware of the land invasion taking place at Azalea Cemetery.“The anti-land invasion unit has been demolishing the structures and a legal intervention is being sought to deal with this matter,” she said.THE MERCURY
