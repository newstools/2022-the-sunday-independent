Cape Town - Recreational cycling organisation Pedal Power Association (PPA) is gearing up to launch a new initiative that will focus on highlighting the lack of prosecution of offenders responsible for fatal crashes and attacks on cyclists.The flagship safe cycling campaign, #CyclistsLivesMatter is set to be launched nationally this coming weekend at the Cradle of Humankind by the association in partnership with the popular cycling store Cycle Lab.PPA Chairperson Steve Hayward said during the last few years, the association has noticed a growing intolerance between motorists and cyclists coupled with an increasing trend of lawlessness among road users, which threatens the safety of cyclists across the country. “Cyclists are taxpayers, contributing members of the community and family members, so each serious injury or death is an unnecessary one we believe can be avoided. We want to see the successful prosecution of drivers responsible for fatal and serious crashes throughout South Africa.”“Currently, offenders who are killing cyclists on the roads are getting away with murder. The campaign was organised to bring this to light. Offenders are getting little to no sentences with some cases being thrown out.”MORE ON THISReady, set, pedal!

The association is also planning to visit the family of late cyclist André Piehl.Cycle Lab co-owner Andrew McLean said that #CyclistsLivesMatter media walls would be placed in their five stores countrywide.“Cyclists participating in the 2022 Cape Town Cycle Tour (CTCT) will be able to take pictures in support of the campaign, at both the registration and finishing points event,” McLean said.The PPA will also host an opportunity for cyclists to take pictures on Chapman’s Peak Drive on Saturday, the week before the CTCT, from 7 to 9 am.The Western Cape Department of Transport said from January 3, 2022, to February 27, 2022, it recorded 245 road accident fatalities, of which 9 (4%) were cyclists.nomalanga.tshuma@inl.co.zaCape Argus
