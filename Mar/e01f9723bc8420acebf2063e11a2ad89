CAPE TOWN - Tyler the pitbull has recovered fully after being shot twice by a SAPS officer in Gugulethu, the Animal Welfare Society of SA (AWS) said.The shooting happened on January 21 while police were conducting a raid at a house, they said.“According to the owner of the property the raid was unlawfully executed without a warrant and his beloved dog who was with him at the time was callously shot twice by one of the officers with what appears to be destructive hollow-point bullets (a bullet that expands on impact),” the AWS said.“He has since opened a case against the officers who allegedly left his house trashed, and his 3-year-old pitbull, Tyler, for dead.“We removed both bullets from Tyler on January 22. He spent the next 10 days recuperating in hospital before being reunited with his worried owner on January 31.“The Nursing Assistant who cared for Tyler described him as ‘a gentle giant without a mean bone in his body’ and hoped that whoever committed this atrocity would be swiftly dealt with.“We can confirm that the shooting is under investigation by the Independent Police Investigations Directorate (Ipid) and that we have offered them our wholehearted support to ensure that whoever shot Tyler is brought to book.”*This story will be updated with the Ipid’s response once received Cape Times
