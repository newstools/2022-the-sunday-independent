Staff Reporter Johannesburg - Names in Uphill Letters, the photo exhibition of South African newsmakers documented by Pimville-based freelance photojournalist, M Jacob Mawela, is headed for the City of Gold, where it’ll open at the Workers Museum in Newtown on the 12 of June. A travelling show, the Johannesburg tenure will constitute its third leg, having made its debut at the Benoni Museum on Heritage Day in 2021, and following up with a stop at the Pretoria Art Museum throughout May. A historiography documented on black-and-white film, it showcases a wide spectrum of subjects ranging from Mr Ples (a Hominid fossil presently on display at the Ditsong National Museum of Natural History in Pretoria and believed by scientists to be about 2, 5 million years old, as well as being the distant relative of all humankind), to past and present role players in science, politics, academia, sport, economics, literature, law, humanities, etc. It aims to dispense visual literacy as a driver of social cohesion mainly, yet not exclusively, amongst the country’s Millennials. Mawela’s work has been appreciated not only in South Africa but also abroad. He was once commissioned by the US Consulate General to teach photography in Soweto, and had some of his work featured in a book on photo-journalism in Southern Africa. He has photographed American presidents, the Pope, the Queen, NBA stars, Hollywood stars, Formula 1 drivers, tennis grand slammers, music megastars, FC Barcelona among other luminaries. Names in Uphill Letters starts on 12 June 2022 at the Workers’ Museum, Newtown.
